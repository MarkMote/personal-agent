# SECTION 1: Prompting Best Practices

# Prompting best practices

---

This guide provides specific prompt engineering techniques for Claude 4.x models, with specific guidance for Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5, and Opus 4.5. These models have been trained for more precise instruction following than previous generations of Claude models.
<Tip>
  For an overview of Claude 4.5's new capabilities, see [What's new in Claude 4.5](/docs/en/about-claude/models/whats-new-claude-4-5). For migration guidance from previous models, see [Migrating to Claude 4.5](/docs/en/about-claude/models/migrating-to-claude-4).
</Tip>

## General principles

### Be explicit with your instructions

Claude 4.x models respond well to clear, explicit instructions. Being specific about your desired output can help enhance results. Customers who desire the "above and beyond" behavior from previous Claude models might need to more explicitly request these behaviors with newer models.

<section title="Example: Creating an analytics dashboard">

**Less effective:**
```text
Create an analytics dashboard
```

**More effective:**
```text
Create an analytics dashboard. Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible. Go beyond the basics to create a fully-featured implementation.
```

</section>

### Add context to improve performance

Providing context or motivation behind your instructions, such as explaining to Claude why such behavior is important, can help Claude 4.x models better understand your goals and deliver more targeted responses.

<section title="Example: Formatting preferences">

**Less effective:**
```text
NEVER use ellipses
```

**More effective:**
```text
Your response will be read aloud by a text-to-speech engine, so never use ellipses since the text-to-speech engine will not know how to pronounce them.
```

</section>

Claude is smart enough to generalize from the explanation.

### Be vigilant with examples & details

Claude 4.x models pay close attention to details and examples as part of their precise instruction following capabilities. Ensure that your examples align with the behaviors you want to encourage and minimize behaviors you want to avoid.

### Long-horizon reasoning and state tracking

Claude 4.5 models excel at long-horizon reasoning tasks with exceptional state tracking capabilities. It maintains orientation across extended sessions by focusing on incremental progress—making steady advances on a few things at a time rather than attempting everything at once. This capability especially emerges over multiple context windows or task iterations, where Claude can work on a complex task, save the state, and continue with a fresh context window.

#### Context awareness and multi-window workflows

Claude 4.5 models feature [context awareness](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows#context-awareness-in-claude-sonnet-4-5), enabling the model to track its remaining context window (i.e. "token budget") throughout a conversation. This enables Claude to execute tasks and manage context more effectively by understanding how much space it has to work.

**Managing context limits:**

If you are using Claude in an agent harness that compacts context or allows saving context to external files (like in Claude Code), we suggest adding this information to your prompt so Claude can behave accordingly. Otherwise, Claude may sometimes naturally try to wrap up work as it approaches the context limit. Below is an example prompt:

```text Sample prompt
Your context window will be automatically compacted as it approaches its limit, allowing you to continue working indefinitely from where you left off. Therefore, do not stop tasks early due to token budget concerns. As you approach your token budget limit, save your current progress and state to memory before the context window refreshes. Always be as persistent and autonomous as possible and complete tasks fully, even if the end of your budget is approaching. Never artificially stop any task early regardless of the context remaining.
```

The [memory tool](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/memory-tool) pairs naturally with context awareness for seamless context transitions.

#### Multi-context window workflows

For tasks spanning multiple context windows:

1. **Use a different prompt for the very first context window**: Use the first context window to set up a framework (write tests, create setup scripts), then use future context windows to iterate on a todo-list.

2. **Have the model write tests in a structured format**: Ask Claude to create tests before starting work and keep track of them in a structured format (e.g., `tests.json`). This leads to better long-term ability to iterate. Remind Claude of the importance of tests: "It is unacceptable to remove or edit tests because this could lead to missing or buggy functionality."

3. **Set up quality of life tools**: Encourage Claude to create setup scripts (e.g., `init.sh`) to gracefully start servers, run test suites, and linters. This prevents repeated work when continuing from a fresh context window.

4. **Starting fresh vs compacting**: When a context window is cleared, consider starting with a brand new context window rather than using compaction. Claude 4.5 models are extremely effective at discovering state from the local filesystem. In some cases, you may want to take advantage of this over compaction. Be prescriptive about how it should start:
   - "Call pwd; you can only read and write files in this directory."
   - "Review progress.txt, tests.json, and the git logs."
   - "Manually run through a fundamental integration test before moving on to implementing new features."

5. **Provide verification tools**: As the length of autonomous tasks grows, Claude needs to verify correctness without continuous human feedback. Tools like Playwright MCP server or computer use capabilities for testing UIs are helpful.

6. **Encourage complete usage of context**: Prompt Claude to efficiently complete components before moving on:

```text Sample prompt
This is a very long task, so it may be beneficial to plan out your work clearly. It's encouraged to spend your entire output context working on the task - just make sure you don't run out of context with significant uncommitted work. Continue working systematically until you have completed this task.
```

#### State management best practices

- **Use structured formats for state data**: When tracking structured information (like test results or task status), use JSON or other structured formats to help Claude understand schema requirements
- **Use unstructured text for progress notes**: Freeform progress notes work well for tracking general progress and context
- **Use git for state tracking**: Git provides a log of what's been done and checkpoints that can be restored. Claude 4.5 models perform especially well in using git to track state across multiple sessions.
- **Emphasize incremental progress**: Explicitly ask Claude to keep track of its progress and focus on incremental work

<section title="Example: State tracking">

```json
// Structured state file (tests.json)
{
  "tests": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "authentication_flow", "status": "passing"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "user_management", "status": "failing"},
    {"id": 3, "name": "api_endpoints", "status": "not_started"}
  ],
  "total": 200,
  "passing": 150,
  "failing": 25,
  "not_started": 25
}
```

```text
// Progress notes (progress.txt)
Session 3 progress:
- Fixed authentication token validation
- Updated user model to handle edge cases
- Next: investigate user_management test failures (test #2)
- Note: Do not remove tests as this could lead to missing functionality
```

</section>

### Communication style

Claude 4.5 models have a more concise and natural communication style compared to previous models:

- **More direct and grounded**: Provides fact-based progress reports rather than self-celebratory updates
- **More conversational**: Slightly more fluent and colloquial, less machine-like
- **Less verbose**: May skip detailed summaries for efficiency unless prompted otherwise

This communication style accurately reflects what has been accomplished without unnecessary elaboration.

## Guidance for specific situations

### Balance verbosity

Claude 4.5 models tend toward efficiency and may skip verbal summaries after tool calls, jumping directly to the next action. While this creates a streamlined workflow, you may prefer more visibility into its reasoning process.

If you want Claude to provide updates as it works:

```text Sample prompt
After completing a task that involves tool use, provide a quick summary of the work you've done.
```

### Tool usage patterns

Claude 4.5 models are trained for precise instruction following and benefits from explicit direction to use specific tools. If you say "can you suggest some changes," it will sometimes provide suggestions rather than implementing them—even if making changes might be what you intended.

For Claude to take action, be more explicit:

<section title="Example: Explicit instructions">

**Less effective (Claude will only suggest):**
```text
Can you suggest some changes to improve this function?
```

**More effective (Claude will make the changes):**
```text
Change this function to improve its performance.
```

Or:
```text
Make these edits to the authentication flow.
```

</section>

To make Claude more proactive about taking action by default, you can add this to your system prompt:

```text Sample prompt for proactive action
<default_to_action>
By default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed, using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. Try to infer the user's intent about whether a tool call (e.g., file edit or read) is intended or not, and act accordingly.
</default_to_action>
```

On the other hand, if you want the model to be more hesitant by default, less prone to jumping straight into implementations, and only take action if requested, you can steer this behavior with a prompt like the below:

```text Sample prompt for conservative action
<do_not_act_before_instructions>
Do not jump into implementatation or changes files unless clearly instructed to make changes. When the user's intent is ambiguous, default to providing information, doing research, and providing recommendations rather than taking action. Only proceed with edits, modifications, or implementations when the user explicitly requests them.
</do_not_act_before_instructions>
```

### Tool usage and triggering

Claude Opus 4.5 is more responsive to the system prompt than previous models. If your prompts were designed to reduce undertriggering on tools or skills, Claude Opus 4.5 may now overtrigger. The fix is to dial back any aggressive language. Where you might have said "CRITICAL: You MUST use this tool when...", you can use more normal prompting like "Use this tool when...".

### Control the format of responses

There are a few ways that we have found to be particularly effective in steering output formatting in Claude 4.x models:

1. **Tell Claude what to do instead of what not to do**

   - Instead of: "Do not use markdown in your response"
   - Try: "Your response should be composed of smoothly flowing prose paragraphs."

2. **Use XML format indicators**

   - Try: "Write the prose sections of your response in \<smoothly_flowing_prose_paragraphs\> tags."

3. **Match your prompt style to the desired output**

   The formatting style used in your prompt may influence Claude's response style. If you are still experiencing steerability issues with output formatting, we recommend as best as you can matching your prompt style to your desired output style. For example, removing markdown from your prompt can reduce the volume of markdown in the output.

4. **Use detailed prompts for specific formatting preferences**

   For more control over markdown and formatting usage, provide explicit guidance:

```text Sample prompt to minimize markdown
<avoid_excessive_markdown_and_bullet_points>
When writing reports, documents, technical explanations, analyses, or any long-form content, write in clear, flowing prose using complete paragraphs and sentences. Use standard paragraph breaks for organization and reserve markdown primarily for `inline code`, code blocks (```...```), and simple headings (###, and ###). Avoid using **bold** and *italics*.

DO NOT use ordered lists (1. ...) or unordered lists (*) unless : a) you're presenting truly discrete items where a list format is the best option, or b) the user explicitly requests a list or ranking

Instead of listing items with bullets or numbers, incorporate them naturally into sentences. This guidance applies especially to technical writing. Using prose instead of excessive formatting will improve user satisfaction. NEVER output a series of overly short bullet points.

Your goal is readable, flowing text that guides the reader naturally through ideas rather than fragmenting information into isolated points.
</avoid_excessive_markdown_and_bullet_points>
```

### Research and information gathering

Claude 4.5 models demonstrate exceptional agentic search capabilities and can find and synthesize information from multiple sources effectively. For optimal research results:

1. **Provide clear success criteria**: Define what constitutes a successful answer to your research question

2. **Encourage source verification**: Ask Claude to verify information across multiple sources

3. **For complex research tasks, use a structured approach**:

```text Sample prompt for complex research
Search for this information in a structured way. As you gather data, develop several competing hypotheses. Track your confidence levels in your progress notes to improve calibration. Regularly self-critique your approach and plan. Update a hypothesis tree or research notes file to persist information and provide transparency. Break down this complex research task systematically.
```

This structured approach allows Claude to find and synthesize virtually any piece of information and iteratively critique its findings, no matter the size of the corpus.

### Subagent orchestration

Claude 4.5 models demonstrate significantly improved native subagent orchestration capabilities. These models can recognize when tasks would benefit from delegating work to specialized subagents and do so proactively without requiring explicit instruction.

To take advantage of this behavior:

1. **Ensure well-defined subagent tools**: Have subagent tools available and described in tool definitions
2. **Let Claude orchestrate naturally**: Claude will delegate appropriately without explicit instruction
3. **Adjust conservativeness if needed**:

```text Sample prompt for conservative subagent usage
Only delegate to subagents when the task clearly benefits from a separate agent with a new context window.
```

### Model self-knowledge

If you would like Claude to identify itself correctly in your application or use specific API strings:

```text Sample prompt for model identity
The assistant is Claude, created by Anthropic. The current model is Claude Sonnet 4.5.
```

For LLM-powered apps that need to specify model strings:

```text Sample prompt for model string
When an LLM is needed, please default to Claude Sonnet 4.5 unless the user requests otherwise. The exact model string for Claude Sonnet 4.5 is claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929.
```

### Thinking sensitivity

When extended thinking is disabled, Claude Opus 4.5 is particularly sensitive to the word "think" and its variants. We recommend replacing "think" with alternative words that convey similar meaning, such as "consider," "believe," and "evaluate."

### Leverage thinking & interleaved thinking capabilities

Claude 4.x models offer thinking capabilities that can be especially helpful for tasks involving reflection after tool use or complex multi-step reasoning. You can guide its initial or interleaved thinking for better results.

```text Example prompt
After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.
```

</Info>

### Document creation

Claude 4.5 models excel at creating presentations, animations, and visual documents. These models match or exceed Claude Opus 4.1 in this domain, with impressive creative flair and stronger instruction following. The models produce polished, usable output on the first try in most cases.

For best results with document creation:

```text Sample prompt
Create a professional presentation on [topic]. Include thoughtful design elements, visual hierarchy, and engaging animations where appropriate.
```

### Improved vision capabilities

Claude Opus 4.5 has improved vision capabilities compared to previous Claude models. It performs better on image processing and data extraction tasks, particularly when there are multiple images present in context. These improvements carry over to computer use, where the model can more reliably interpret screenshots and UI elements. You can also use Claude Opus 4.5 to analyze videos by breaking them up into frames.

One technique we've found effective to further boost performance is to give Claude Opus 4.5 a crop tool or [skill](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview). We've seen consistent uplift on image evaluations when Claude is able to "zoom" in on relevant regions of an image. We've put together a cookbook for the crop tool [here](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/multimodal-crop-tool).

### Optimize parallel tool calling

Claude 4.x models excel at parallel tool execution, with Sonnet 4.5 being particularly aggressive in firing off multiple operations simultaneously. Claude 4.x models will:

- Run multiple speculative searches during research
- Read several files at once to build context faster
- Execute bash commands in parallel (which can even bottleneck system performance)

This behavior is easily steerable. While the model has a high success rate in parallel tool calling without prompting, you can boost this to ~100% or adjust the aggression level:

```text Sample prompt for maximum parallel efficiency
<use_parallel_tool_calls>
If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between the tool calls, make all of the independent tool calls in parallel. Prioritize calling tools simultaneously whenever the actions can be done in parallel rather than sequentially. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase speed and efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values like the parameters, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.
</use_parallel_tool_calls>
```

```text Sample prompt to reduce parallel execution
Execute operations sequentially with brief pauses between each step to ensure stability.
```

### Reduce file creation in agentic coding

Claude 4.x models may sometimes create new files for testing and iteration purposes, particularly when working with code. This approach allows Claude to use files, especially python scripts, as a 'temporary scratchpad' before saving its final output. Using temporary files can improve outcomes particularly for agentic coding use cases.

If you'd prefer to minimize net new file creation, you can instruct Claude to clean up after itself:

```text Sample prompt
If you create any temporary new files, scripts, or helper files for iteration, clean up these files by removing them at the end of the task.
```

### Overeagerness and file creation

Claude Opus 4.5 has a tendency to overengineer by creating extra files, adding unnecessary abstractions, or building in flexibility that wasn't requested. If you're seeing this undesired behavior, add explicit prompting to keep solutions minimal.

For example:

```text Sample prompt to minimize overengineering
Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary. Keep solutions simple and focused.

Don't add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability.

Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Don't use backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.

Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task. Reuse existing abstractions where possible and follow the DRY principle.
```

### Frontend design

Claude 4.x models, particularly Opus 4.5, excel at building complex, real-world web applications with strong frontend design. However, without guidance, models can default to generic patterns that create what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. To create distinctive, creative frontends that surprise and delight:

<Tip>
For a detailed guide on improving frontend design, see our blog post on [improving frontend design through skills](https://www.claude.com/blog/improving-frontend-design-through-skills).
</Tip>

Here's a system prompt snippet you can use to encourage better frontend design:

```text Sample prompt for frontend aesthetics
<frontend_aesthetics>
You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.

Focus on:
- Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.
- Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.
- Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.
- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations. Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box!
</frontend_aesthetics>
```

You can also refer to the full skill [here](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/plugins/frontend-design/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md).

### Avoid focusing on passing tests and hard-coding

Claude 4.x models can sometimes focus too heavily on making tests pass at the expense of more general solutions, or may use workarounds like helper scripts for complex refactoring instead of using standard tools directly. To prevent this behavior and ensure robust, generalizable solutions:

```text Sample prompt
Please write a high-quality, general-purpose solution using the standard tools available. Do not create helper scripts or workarounds to accomplish the task more efficiently. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem generally.

Focus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.

If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please inform me rather than working around them. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.
```

### Encouraging code exploration

Claude Opus 4.5 is highly capable but can be overly conservative when exploring code. If you notice the model proposing solutions without looking at the code or making assumptions about code it hasn't read, the best solution is to add explicit instructions to the prompt. Claude Opus 4.5 is our most steerable model to date and responds reliably to direct guidance.

For example:

```text Sample prompt for code exploration
ALWAYS read and understand relevant files before proposing code edits. Do not speculate about code you have not inspected. If the user references a specific file/path, you MUST open and inspect it before explaining or proposing fixes. Be rigorous and persistent in searching code for key facts. Thoroughly review the style, conventions, and abstractions of the codebase before implementing new features or abstractions.
```

### Minimizing hallucinations in agentic coding

Claude 4.x models are less prone to hallucinations and give more accurate, grounded, intelligent answers based on the code. To encourage this behavior even more and minimize hallucinations:

```text Sample prompt
<investigate_before_answering>
Never speculate about code you have not opened. If the user references a specific file, you MUST read the file before answering. Make sure to investigate and read relevant files BEFORE answering questions about the codebase. Never make any claims about code before investigating unless you are certain of the correct answer - give grounded and hallucination-free answers.
</investigate_before_answering>
```

## Migration considerations

When migrating to Claude 4.5 models:

1. **Be specific about desired behavior**: Consider describing exactly what you'd like to see in the output.

2. **Frame your instructions with modifiers**: Adding modifiers that encourage Claude to increase the quality and detail of its output can help better shape Claude's performance. For example, instead of "Create an analytics dashboard", use "Create an analytics dashboard. Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible. Go beyond the basics to create a fully-featured implementation."

3. **Request specific features explicitly**: Animations and interactive elements should be requested explicitly when desired.

This guide covers common patterns for working with the Messages API, including basic requests, multi-turn conversations, prefill techniques, and vision capabilities. For complete API specifications, see the [Messages API reference](/docs/en/api/messages).

## Basic request and response

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  #!/bin/sh
  curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
       --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
       --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
       --header "content-type: application/json" \
       --data \
  '{
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
      "max_tokens": 1024,
      "messages": [
          {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
      ]
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python
  import anthropic

  message = anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
      model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
      max_tokens=1024,
      messages=[
          {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
      ]
  )
  print(message)
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript
  import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

  const anthropic = new Anthropic();

  const message = await anthropic.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5',
    max_tokens: 1024,
    messages: [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
    ]
  });
  console.log(message);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```json JSON
{
  "id": "msg_01XFDUDYJgAACzvnptvVoYEL",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Hello!"
    }
  ],
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "stop_reason": "end_turn",
  "stop_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 12,
    "output_tokens": 6
  }
}
```

## Multiple conversational turns

The Messages API is stateless, which means that you always send the full conversational history to the API. You can use this pattern to build up a conversation over time. Earlier conversational turns don't necessarily need to actually originate from Claude — you can use synthetic `assistant` messages.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Shell
#!/bin/sh

     --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
     --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
     --header "content-type: application/json" \
     --data \
'{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",

```

```python Python

        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you describe LLMs to me?"}
    ],
)
print(message)

```

```typescript TypeScript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const anthropic = new Anthropic();

await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5',
  max_tokens: 1024,
  messages: [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you describe LLMs to me?"}
  ]
});
```
</CodeGroup>

```json JSON
{
    "id": "msg_018gCsTGsXkYJVqYPxTgDHBU",
    "type": "message",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [
        {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "Sure, I'd be happy to provide..."
        }
    ],

    "stop_sequence": null,
    "usage": {
      "input_tokens": 30,
      "output_tokens": 309
    }
}
```

## Putting words in Claude's mouth

You can pre-fill part of Claude's response in the last position of the input messages list. This can be used to shape Claude's response. The example below uses `"max_tokens": 1` to get a single multiple choice answer from Claude.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  #!/bin/sh
  curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
       --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
       --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
       --header "content-type: application/json" \
       --data \
  '{
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
      "max_tokens": 1,
      "messages": [
          {"role": "user", "content": "What is latin for Ant? (A) Apoidea, (B) Rhopalocera, (C) Formicidae"},
          {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is ("}
      ]
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python
  import anthropic

  message = anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
      model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
      max_tokens=1,

## Vision

Claude can read both text and images in requests. We support both `base64` and `url` source types for images, and the `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types. See our [vision guide](/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision) for more details.

# SECTION 2: Tool Use with Claude (Overview)

# Tool use with Claude

---

Claude is capable of interacting with tools and functions, allowing you to extend Claude's capabilities to perform a wider variety of tasks. 

<Tip>
  Learn everything you need to master tool use with Claude as part of our new [courses](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/)! Please
  continue to share your ideas and suggestions using this
  [form](https://forms.gle/BFnYc6iCkWoRzFgk7).
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Guarantee schema conformance with strict tool use**

[Structured Outputs](/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs) provides guaranteed schema validation for tool inputs. Add `strict: true` to your tool definitions to ensure Claude's tool calls always match your schema exactly—no more type mismatches or missing fields.

Perfect for production agents where invalid tool parameters would cause failures. [Learn when to use strict tool use →](/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs#when-to-use-json-outputs-vs-strict-tool-use)

## How tool use works

Claude supports two types of tools:

1. **Client tools**: Tools that execute on your systems, which include:
   - User-defined custom tools that you create and implement
   - Anthropic-defined tools like [computer use](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/computer-use-tool) and [text editor](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/text-editor-tool) that require client implementation

2. **Server tools**: Tools that execute on Anthropic's servers, like the [web search](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool) and [web fetch](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool) tools. These tools must be specified in the API request but don't require implementation on your part.

<Note>
Anthropic-defined tools use versioned types (e.g., `web_search_20250305`, `text_editor_20250124`) to ensure compatibility across model versions.
</Note>

### Client tools
Integrate client tools with Claude in these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provide Claude with tools and a user prompt">
    - Define client tools with names, descriptions, and input schemas in your API request.
    - Include a user prompt that might require these tools, e.g., "What's the weather in San Francisco?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claude decides to use a tool">
    - Claude assesses if any tools can help with the user's query.
    - If yes, Claude constructs a properly formatted tool use request.
    - For client tools, the API response has a `stop_reason` of `tool_use`, signaling Claude's intent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute the tool and return results">
    - Extract the tool name and input from Claude's request
    - Execute the tool code on your system
    - Return the results in a new `user` message containing a `tool_result` content block
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claude uses tool result to formulate a response">
    - Claude analyzes the tool results to craft its final response to the original user prompt.
  </Step>
</Steps>
Note: Steps 3 and 4 are optional. For some workflows, Claude's tool use request (step 2) might be all you need, without sending results back to Claude.

### Server tools

Server tools follow a different workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provide Claude with tools and a user prompt">
    - Server tools, like [web search](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool) and [web fetch](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool), have their own parameters.
    - Include a user prompt that might require these tools, e.g., "Search for the latest news about AI" or "Analyze the content at this URL."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claude executes the server tool">
    - Claude assesses if a server tool can help with the user's query.
    - If yes, Claude executes the tool, and the results are automatically incorporated into Claude's response.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claude uses the server tool result to formulate a response">
    - Claude analyzes the server tool results to craft its final response to the original user prompt.
    - No additional user interaction is needed for server tool execution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using MCP tools with Claude

If you're building an application that uses the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), you can use tools from MCP servers directly with Claude's Messages API. MCP tool definitions use a schema format that's similar to Claude's tool format. You just need to rename `inputSchema` to `input_schema`.

<Tip>
**Don't want to build your own MCP client?** Use the [MCP connector](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-connector) to connect directly to remote MCP servers from the Messages API without implementing a client.
</Tip>

### Converting MCP tools to Claude format

When you build an MCP client and call `list_tools()` on an MCP server, you'll receive tool definitions with an `inputSchema` field. To use these tools with Claude, convert them to Claude's format:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from mcp import ClientSession

async def get_claude_tools(mcp_session: ClientSession):
    """Convert MCP tools to Claude's tool format."""
    mcp_tools = await mcp_session.list_tools()

    claude_tools = []
    for tool in mcp_tools.tools:
        claude_tools.append({
            "name": tool.name,
            "description": tool.description or "",
            "input_schema": tool.inputSchema  # Rename inputSchema to input_schema
        })

    return claude_tools
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";

async function getClaudeTools(mcpClient: Client) {
  // Convert MCP tools to Claude's tool format
  const mcpTools = await mcpClient.listTools();

  return mcpTools.tools.map((tool) => ({
    name: tool.name,
    description: tool.description ?? "",
    input_schema: tool.inputSchema, // Rename inputSchema to input_schema
  }));
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Then pass these converted tools to Claude:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()
claude_tools = await get_claude_tools(mcp_session)

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=claude_tools,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What tools do you have available?"}]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const anthropic = new Anthropic();
const claudeTools = await getClaudeTools(mcpClient);

const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  max_tokens: 1024,
  tools: claudeTools,
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What tools do you have available?" }],
});
```
</CodeGroup>

When Claude responds with a `tool_use` block, execute the tool on your MCP server using `call_tool()` and return the result to Claude in a `tool_result` block.

For a complete guide to building MCP clients, see [Build an MCP client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/build-client).

Claude will return a response similar to:

```json JSON
{
  "id": "msg_01Aq9w938a90dw8q",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "stop_reason": "tool_use",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "I'll check the current weather in San Francisco for you."
    },
    {
      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9",
      "name": "get_weather",
      "input": {"location": "San Francisco, CA", "unit": "celsius"}
    }
  ]
}
```

You would then need to execute the `get_weather` function with the provided input, and return the result in a new `user` message:

This will print Claude's final response, incorporating the weather data:

```json JSON
{
  "id": "msg_01Aq9w938a90dw8q",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "stop_reason": "stop_sequence",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "The current weather in San Francisco is 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit). It's a cool day in the city by the bay!"
    }
  ]
}
```

</section>
<section title="Parallel tool use">

Claude can call multiple tools in parallel within a single response, which is useful for tasks that require multiple independent operations. When using parallel tools, all `tool_use` blocks are included in a single assistant message, and all corresponding `tool_result` blocks must be provided in the subsequent user message.

<Note>
**Important**: Tool results must be formatted correctly to avoid API errors and ensure Claude continues using parallel tools. See our [implementation guide](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/implement-tool-use#parallel-tool-use) for detailed formatting requirements and complete code examples.
</Note>

For comprehensive examples, test scripts, and best practices for implementing parallel tool calls, see the [parallel tool use section](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/implement-tool-use#parallel-tool-use) in our implementation guide.

<section title="Multiple tool example">

You can provide Claude with multiple tools to choose from in a single request. Here's an example with both a `get_weather` and a `get_time` tool, along with a user query that asks for both.

In this case, Claude may either:
- Use the tools sequentially (one at a time) — calling `get_weather` first, then `get_time` after receiving the weather result
- Use parallel tool calls — outputting multiple `tool_use` blocks in a single response when the operations are independent

When Claude makes parallel tool calls, you must return all tool results in a single `user` message, with each result in its own `tool_result` block.

</section>
<section title="Missing information">

If the user's prompt doesn't include enough information to fill all the required parameters for a tool, Claude Opus is much more likely to recognize that a parameter is missing and ask for it. Claude Sonnet may ask, especially when prompted to think before outputting a tool request. But it may also do its best to infer a reasonable value.

For example, using the `get_weather` tool above, if you ask Claude "What's the weather?" without specifying a location, Claude, particularly Claude Sonnet, may make a guess about tools inputs:

```json JSON
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "id": "toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9",
  "name": "get_weather",
  "input": {"location": "New York, NY", "unit": "fahrenheit"}
}
```

This behavior is not guaranteed, especially for more ambiguous prompts and for less intelligent models. If Claude Opus doesn't have enough context to fill in the required parameters, it is far more likely respond with a clarifying question instead of making a tool call.

</section>
<section title="Sequential tools">

Some tasks may require calling multiple tools in sequence, using the output of one tool as the input to another. In such a case, Claude will call one tool at a time. If prompted to call the tools all at once, Claude is likely to guess parameters for tools further downstream if they are dependent on tool results for tools further upstream.

Here's an example of using a `get_location` tool to get the user's location, then passing that location to the `get_weather` tool:

            Message message = client.messages().create(params);
            System.out.println(message);
        }
    }
    ```

</CodeGroup>

In this case, Claude would first call the `get_location` tool to get the user's location. After you return the location in a `tool_result`, Claude would then call `get_weather` with that location to get the final answer.

The full conversation might look like:

| Role      | Content                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User      | What's the weather like where I am?                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Assistant | I'll find your current location first, then check the weather there. \[Tool use for get_location\] |
| User      | \[Tool result for get_location with matching id and result of San Francisco, CA\]                                                                                                                                                       |
| Assistant | \[Tool use for get_weather with the following input\]\{ "location": "San Francisco, CA", "unit": "fahrenheit" }                                                                                                                         |
| User      | \[Tool result for get_weather with matching id and result of "59°F (15°C), mostly cloudy"\]                                                                                                                                             |
| Assistant | Based on your current location in San Francisco, CA, the weather right now is 59°F (15°C) and mostly cloudy. It's a fairly cool and overcast day in the city. You may want to bring a light jacket if you're heading outside.           |

This example demonstrates how Claude can chain together multiple tool calls to answer a question that requires gathering data from different sources. The key steps are:

1. Claude first realizes it needs the user's location to answer the weather question, so it calls the `get_location` tool.
2. The user (i.e. the client code) executes the actual `get_location` function and returns the result "San Francisco, CA" in a `tool_result` block.
3. With the location now known, Claude proceeds to call the `get_weather` tool, passing in "San Francisco, CA" as the `location` parameter (as well as a guessed `unit` parameter, as `unit` is not a required parameter).
4. The user again executes the actual `get_weather` function with the provided arguments and returns the weather data in another `tool_result` block.
5. Finally, Claude incorporates the weather data into a natural language response to the original question.

</section>
<section title="Chain of thought tool use">

By default, Claude Opus is prompted to think before it answers a tool use query to best determine whether a tool is necessary, which tool to use, and the appropriate parameters. Claude Sonnet and Claude Haiku are prompted to try to use tools as much as possible and are more likely to call an unnecessary tool or infer missing parameters. To prompt Sonnet or Haiku to better assess the user query before making tool calls, the following prompt can be used:

Chain of thought prompt

`Answer the user's request using relevant tools (if they are available). Before calling a tool, do some analysis. First, think about which of the provided tools is the relevant tool to answer the user's request. Second, go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, proceed with the tool call. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the function (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided.
`

## Pricing

Tool use requests are priced based on:
1. The total number of input tokens sent to the model (including in the `tools` parameter)
2. The number of output tokens generated
3. For server-side tools, additional usage-based pricing (e.g., web search charges per search performed)

Client-side tools are priced the same as any other Claude API request, while server-side tools may incur additional charges based on their specific usage.

The additional tokens from tool use come from:

- The `tools` parameter in API requests (tool names, descriptions, and schemas)
- `tool_use` content blocks in API requests and responses
- `tool_result` content blocks in API requests

When you use `tools`, we also automatically include a special system prompt for the model which enables tool use. The number of tool use tokens required for each model are listed below (excluding the additional tokens listed above). Note that the table assumes at least 1 tool is provided. If no `tools` are provided, then a tool choice of `none` uses 0 additional system prompt tokens.

| Model                    | Tool choice                                          | Tool use system prompt token count          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Claude Opus 4.5            | `auto`, `none`<hr />`any`, `tool`   | 346 tokens<hr />313 tokens |
| Claude Opus 4.1            | `auto`, `none`<hr />`any`, `tool`   | 346 tokens<hr />313 tokens |
| Claude Opus 4            | `auto`, `none`<hr />`any`, `tool`   | 346 tokens<hr />313 tokens |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5          | `auto`, `none`<hr />`any`, `tool`   | 346 tokens<hr />313 tokens |
| Claude Sonnet 4          | `auto`, `none`<hr />`any`, `tool`   | 346 tokens<hr />313 tokens |
| Claude Sonnet 3.7 ([deprecated](/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations))        | `auto`, `none`<hr />`any`, `tool`   | 346 tokens<hr />313 tokens |
| Claude Haiku 4.5         | `auto`, `none`<hr />`any`, `tool`   | 346 tokens<hr />313 tokens |
| Claude Haiku 3.5         | `auto`, `none`<hr />`any`, `tool`   | 264 tokens<hr />340 tokens |
| Claude Opus 3 ([deprecated](/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations))            | `auto`, `none`<hr />`any`, `tool`   | 530 tokens<hr />281 tokens |
| Claude Sonnet 3          | `auto`, `none`<hr />`any`, `tool`   | 159 tokens<hr />235 tokens |
| Claude Haiku 3           | `auto`, `none`<hr />`any`, `tool`   | 264 tokens<hr />340 tokens |

These token counts are added to your normal input and output tokens to calculate the total cost of a request.

Refer to our [models overview table](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview#latest-models-comparison) for current per-model prices.

When you send a tool use prompt, just like any other API request, the response will output both input and output token counts as part of the reported `usage` metrics.

## Choosing a model

We recommend using the latest Claude Sonnet (4.5) or Claude Opus (4.5) model for complex tools and ambiguous queries; they handle multiple tools better and seek clarification when needed.

Use Claude Haiku models for straightforward tools, but note they may infer missing parameters.

<Tip>
If using Claude with tool use and extended thinking, refer to our guide [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) for more information.
</Tip>

## Specifying client tools

Client tools (both Anthropic-defined and user-defined) are specified in the `tools` top-level parameter of the API request. Each tool definition includes:

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                         |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`         | The name of the tool. Must match the regex `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`.                                 |
| `description`  | A detailed plaintext description of what the tool does, when it should be used, and how it behaves. |
| `input_schema` | A [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) object defining the expected parameters for the tool.     |
| `input_examples` | (Optional, beta) An array of example input objects to help Claude understand how to use the tool. See [Providing tool use examples](#providing-tool-use-examples). |

<section title="Example simple tool definition">

```json JSON
{
  "name": "get_weather",
  "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
      },
      "unit": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
        "description": "The unit of temperature, either 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'"
      }
    },
    "required": ["location"]
  }
}
```

This tool, named `get_weather`, expects an input object with a required `location` string and an optional `unit` string that must be either "celsius" or "fahrenheit".

</section>

### Tool use system prompt

When you call the Claude API with the `tools` parameter, we construct a special system prompt from the tool definitions, tool configuration, and any user-specified system prompt. The constructed prompt is designed to instruct the model to use the specified tool(s) and provide the necessary context for the tool to operate properly:

```
In this environment you have access to a set of tools you can use to answer the user's question.
{{ FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS }}
String and scalar parameters should be specified as is, while lists and objects should use JSON format. Note that spaces for string values are not stripped. The output is not expected to be valid XML and is parsed with regular expressions.
Here are the functions available in JSONSchema format:
{{ TOOL DEFINITIONS IN JSON SCHEMA }}
{{ USER SYSTEM PROMPT }}
{{ TOOL CONFIGURATION }}
```

### Best practices for tool definitions

To get the best performance out of Claude when using tools, follow these guidelines:

- **Provide extremely detailed descriptions.** This is by far the most important factor in tool performance. Your descriptions should explain every detail about the tool, including:
  - What the tool does
  - When it should be used (and when it shouldn't)
  - What each parameter means and how it affects the tool's behavior
  - Any important caveats or limitations, such as what information the tool does not return if the tool name is unclear. The more context you can give Claude about your tools, the better it will be at deciding when and how to use them. Aim for at least 3-4 sentences per tool description, more if the tool is complex.
- **Prioritize descriptions, but consider using `input_examples` for complex tools.** Clear descriptions are most important, but for tools with complex inputs, nested objects, or format-sensitive parameters, you can use the `input_examples` field (beta) to provide schema-validated examples. See [Providing tool use examples](#providing-tool-use-examples) for details.

<section title="Example of a good tool description">

```json JSON
{
  "name": "get_stock_price",
  "description": "Retrieves the current stock price for a given ticker symbol. The ticker symbol must be a valid symbol for a publicly traded company on a major US stock exchange like NYSE or NASDAQ. The tool will return the latest trade price in USD. It should be used when the user asks about the current or most recent price of a specific stock. It will not provide any other information about the stock or company.",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "ticker": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
      }
    },
    "required": ["ticker"]
  }
}
```

</section>

<section title="Example poor tool description">

```json JSON
{
  "name": "get_stock_price",
  "description": "Gets the stock price for a ticker.",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "ticker": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": ["ticker"]
  }
}
```

</section>

The good description clearly explains what the tool does, when to use it, what data it returns, and what the `ticker` parameter means. The poor description is too brief and leaves Claude with many open questions about the tool's behavior and usage.

## Providing tool use examples

You can provide concrete examples of valid tool inputs to help Claude understand how to use your tools more effectively. This is particularly useful for complex tools with nested objects, optional parameters, or format-sensitive inputs.

<Info>
Tool use examples is a beta feature. Include the appropriate [beta header](/docs/en/api/beta-headers) for your provider:

| Provider | Beta header | Supported models |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Claude API,<br/>Microsoft Foundry | `advanced-tool-use-2025-11-20` | All models |
| Vertex AI,<br/>Amazon Bedrock | `tool-examples-2025-10-29` | Claude Opus 4.5 only |
</Info>

### Basic usage

Add an optional `input_examples` field to your tool definition with an array of example input objects. Each example must be valid according to the tool's `input_schema`:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    max_tokens=1024,
    betas=["advanced-tool-use-2025-11-20"],
    tools=[
        {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
            "input_schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
                    },
                    "unit": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
                        "description": "The unit of temperature"
                    }
                },
                "required": ["location"]
            },
            "input_examples": [
                {
                    "location": "San Francisco, CA",
                    "unit": "fahrenheit"
                },
                {
                    "location": "Tokyo, Japan",
                    "unit": "celsius"
                },
                {
                    "location": "New York, NY"  # 'unit' is optional
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in San Francisco?"}
    ]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const client = new Anthropic();

const response = await client.messages.create({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  max_tokens: 1024,
  betas: ["advanced-tool-use-2025-11-20"],
  tools: [
    {
      name: "get_weather",
      description: "Get the current weather in a given location",
      input_schema: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          location: {
            type: "string",
            description: "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
          },
          unit: {
            type: "string",
            enum: ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
            description: "The unit of temperature",
          },
        },
        required: ["location"],
      },
      input_examples: [
        {
          location: "San Francisco, CA",
          unit: "fahrenheit",
        },
        {
          location: "Tokyo, Japan",
          unit: "celsius",
        },
        {
          location: "New York, NY",
          // Demonstrates that 'unit' is optional
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What's the weather like in San Francisco?" }],
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Examples are included in the prompt alongside your tool schema, showing Claude concrete patterns for well-formed tool calls. This helps Claude understand when to include optional parameters, what formats to use, and how to structure complex inputs.

### Requirements and limitations

- **Schema validation** - Each example must be valid according to the tool's `input_schema`. Invalid examples return a 400 error
- **Not supported for server-side tools** - Only user-defined tools can have input examples
- **Token cost** - Examples add to prompt tokens: ~20-50 tokens for simple examples, ~100-200 tokens for complex nested objects

## Tool runner (beta)

The tool runner provides an out-of-the-box solution for executing tools with Claude. Instead of manually handling tool calls, tool results, and conversation management, the tool runner automatically:

- Executes tools when Claude calls them
- Handles the request/response cycle
- Manages conversation state
- Provides type safety and validation

We recommend that you use the tool runner for most tool use implementations.

<Note>
The tool runner is currently in beta and available in the [Python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/blob/main/tools.md), [TypeScript](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript/blob/main/helpers.md#tool-helpers), and [Ruby](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-ruby/blob/main/helpers.md#3-auto-looping-tool-runner-beta) SDKs.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Automatic context management with compaction**

The tool runner supports automatic [compaction](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing#client-side-compaction-sdk), which generates summaries when token usage exceeds a threshold. This allows long-running agentic tasks to continue beyond context window limits.
</Tip>

### Basic usage

Define tools using the SDK helpers, then use the tool runner to execute them.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

Use the `@beta_tool` decorator to define tools with type hints and docstrings.

<Note>
If you're using the async client, replace `@beta_tool` with `@beta_async_tool` and define the function with `async def`.
</Note>

```python
import anthropic
import json
from anthropic import beta_tool

# Initialize client
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Define tools using the decorator
@beta_tool
def get_weather(location: str, unit: str = "fahrenheit") -> str:
    """Get the current weather in a given location.

    Args:
        location: The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA
        unit: Temperature unit, either 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'
    """
    # In a full implementation, you'd call a weather API here
    return json.dumps({"temperature": "20°C", "condition": "Sunny"})

@beta_tool
def calculate_sum(a: int, b: int) -> str:
    """Add two numbers together.

    Args:
        a: First number
        b: Second number
    """
    return str(a + b)

# Use the tool runner
runner = client.beta.messages.tool_runner(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[get_weather, calculate_sum],
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Paris? Also, what's 15 + 27?"}
    ]
)
for message in runner:
    print(message.content[0].text)
```

The `@beta_tool` decorator inspects the function arguments and docstring to extract a JSON schema representation. For example, `calculate_sum` becomes:

```json
{
  "name": "calculate_sum",
  "description": "Adds two integers together.",
  "input_schema": {
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "left": {
        "description": "The first integer to add.",
        "title": "Left",
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "right": {
        "description": "The second integer to add.",
        "title": "Right",
        "type": "integer"
      }
    },
    "required": ["left", "right"],
    "type": "object"
  }
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

Use `betaZodTool()` for type-safe tool definitions with Zod validation, or `betaTool()` for JSON Schema-based definitions.

TypeScript offers two approaches for defining tools:

**Using Zod (recommended)** - Use `betaZodTool()` for type-safe tool definitions with Zod validation (requires Zod 3.25.0 or higher):

```typescript
import { Anthropic } from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';
import { betaZodTool } from '@anthropic-ai/sdk/helpers/beta/zod';
import { z } from 'zod';

const anthropic = new Anthropic();

const getWeatherTool = betaZodTool({
  name: 'get_weather',
  description: 'Get the current weather in a given location',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe('The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA'),
    unit: z.enum(['celsius', 'fahrenheit']).default('fahrenheit')
      .describe('Temperature unit')
  }),
  run: async (input) => {
    // In a full implementation, you'd call a weather API here
    return JSON.stringify({temperature: '20°C', condition: 'Sunny'});
  }
});

const runner = anthropic.beta.messages.toolRunner({
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5',
  max_tokens: 1024,
  tools: [getWeatherTool],
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: "What's the weather like in Paris?" }]
});

for await (const message of runner) {
  console.log(message.content[0].text);
}
```

**Using JSON Schema** - Use `betaTool()` for type-safe tool definitions without Zod:

<Note>
The input generated by Claude will not be validated at runtime. Perform validation inside the `run` function if needed.
</Note>

```typescript
import { Anthropic } from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';
import { betaTool } from '@anthropic-ai/sdk/helpers/beta/json-schema';

const anthropic = new Anthropic();

const calculateSumTool = betaTool({
  name: 'calculate_sum',
  description: 'Add two numbers together',
  inputSchema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      a: { type: 'number', description: 'First number' },

    required: ['a', 'b']
  },
  run: async (input) => {
    return String(input.a + input.b);

Use the `Anthropic::BaseTool` class to define tools with typed input schemas.

```ruby
require "anthropic"

# Initialize client
client = Anthropic::Client.new

# Define input schema
class GetWeatherInput < Anthropic::BaseModel
  required :location, String, doc: "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
  optional :unit, Anthropic::InputSchema::EnumOf["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
           doc: "Temperature unit"
end

# Define tool
class GetWeather < Anthropic::BaseTool
  doc "Get the current weather in a given location"
  input_schema GetWeatherInput

  def call(input)
    # In a full implementation, you'd call a weather API here
    JSON.generate({temperature: "20°C", condition: "Sunny"})
  end
end

class CalculateSumInput < Anthropic::BaseModel
  required :a, Integer, doc: "First number"
  required :b, Integer, doc: "Second number"
end

class CalculateSum < Anthropic::BaseTool
  doc "Add two numbers together"
  input_schema CalculateSumInput

  def call(input)
    (input.a + input.b).to_s
  end
end

# Use the tool runner
runner = client.beta.messages.tool_runner(
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  max_tokens: 1024,
  tools: [GetWeather.new, CalculateSum.new],
  messages: [
    {role: "user", content: "What's the weather like in Paris? Also, what's 15 + 27?"}
  ]
)

runner.each_message do |message|
  message.content.each do |block|
    puts block.text if block.respond_to?(:text)
  end
end
```

The `Anthropic::BaseTool` class uses the `doc` method for the tool description and `input_schema` to define the expected parameters. The SDK automatically converts this to the appropriate JSON schema format.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

The tool function must return a content block or content block array, including text, images, or document blocks. This allows tools to return rich, multimodal responses. Returned strings will be converted to a text content block. If you want to return a structured JSON object to Claude, encode it to a JSON string before returning it. Numbers, booleans, or other non-string primitives must also be converted to strings.

### Iterating over the tool runner

The tool runner is an iterable that yields messages from Claude. This is often referred to as a "tool call loop". Each iteration, the runner checks if Claude requested a tool use. If so, it calls the tool and sends the result back to Claude automatically, then yields the next message from Claude to continue your loop.

You can end the loop at any iteration with a `break` statement. The runner will loop until Claude returns a message without a tool use.

If you don't need intermediate messages, you can get the final message directly:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

Use `runner.until_done()` to get the final message.

```python
runner = client.beta.messages.tool_runner(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[get_weather, calculate_sum],
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Paris? Also, what's 15 + 27?"}
    ]
)
final_message = runner.until_done()
print(final_message.content[0].text)
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

Simply `await` the runner to get the final message.

```typescript
const runner = anthropic.beta.messages.toolRunner({
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5',
  max_tokens: 1024,
  tools: [getWeatherTool],
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: "What's the weather like in Paris?" }]
});

const finalMessage = await runner;
console.log(finalMessage.content[0].text);
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Ruby">

Use `runner.run_until_finished` to get all messages.

```ruby
runner = client.beta.messages.tool_runner(
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  max_tokens: 1024,
  tools: [GetWeather.new, CalculateSum.new],
  messages: [
    {role: "user", content: "What's the weather like in Paris? Also, what's 15 + 27?"}
  ]
)

all_messages = runner.run_until_finished
all_messages.each { |msg| puts msg.content }
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Advanced usage

Within the loop, you can fully customize the tool runner's next request to the Messages API. The runner automatically appends tool results to the message history, so you don't need to manually manage them. You can optionally inspect the tool result for logging or debugging, and modify the request parameters before the next API call.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

Use `generate_tool_call_response()` to optionally inspect the tool result (the runner appends it automatically). Use `set_messages_params()` and `append_messages()` to modify the request.

```python
runner = client.beta.messages.tool_runner(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[get_weather],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in San Francisco?"}]
)
for message in runner:
    # Optional: inspect the tool response (automatically appended by the runner)
    tool_response = runner.generate_tool_call_response()
    if tool_response:
        print(f"Tool result: {tool_response}")

    # Customize the next request
    runner.set_messages_params(lambda params: {
        **params,
        "max_tokens": 2048  # Increase tokens for next request
    })

    # Or add additional messages
    runner.append_messages(
        {"role": "user", "content": "Please be concise in your response."}
    )
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

Use `generateToolResponse()` to optionally inspect the tool result (the runner appends it automatically). Use `setMessagesParams()` and `pushMessages()` to modify the request.

```typescript
const runner = anthropic.beta.messages.toolRunner({
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5',
  max_tokens: 1024,
  tools: [getWeatherTool],
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: "What's the weather in San Francisco?" }]
});

for await (const message of runner) {
  // Optional: inspect the tool result message (automatically appended by the runner)
  const toolResultMessage = await runner.generateToolResponse();
  if (toolResultMessage) {
    console.log('Tool result:', toolResultMessage);
  }

  // Customize the next request
  runner.setMessagesParams(params => ({
    ...params,
    max_tokens: 2048  // Increase tokens for next request
  }));

  // Or add additional messages
  runner.pushMessages(
    { role: 'user', content: 'Please be concise in your response.' }
  );
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Ruby">

Use `next_message` for step-by-step control. Use `feed_messages` to inject messages and `params` to access parameters.

```ruby
runner = client.beta.messages.tool_runner(
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  max_tokens: 1024,
  tools: [GetWeather.new],
  messages: [{role: "user", content: "What's the weather in San Francisco?"}]
)

# Manual step-by-step control
message = runner.next_message
puts message.content

# Inject follow-up messages
runner.feed_messages([
  {role: "user", content: "Also check Boston"}
])

# Access current parameters
puts runner.params
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Debugging tool execution

When a tool throws an exception, the tool runner catches it and returns the error to Claude as a tool result with `is_error: true`. By default, only the exception message is included, not the full stack trace.

To view full stack traces and debug information, set the `ANTHROPIC_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
# View info-level logs including tool errors
export ANTHROPIC_LOG=info

# View debug-level logs for more verbose output
export ANTHROPIC_LOG=debug
```

When enabled, the SDK logs full exception details (using Python's `logging` module, the console in TypeScript, or Ruby's logger), including the complete stack trace when a tool fails.

#### Intercepting tool errors

By default, tool errors are passed back to Claude, which can then respond appropriately. However, you may want to detect errors and handle them differently—for example, to stop execution early or implement custom error handling.

Use the tool response method to intercept tool results and check for errors before they're sent to Claude:

<Tabs>

```python
import json

runner = client.beta.messages.tool_runner(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",

    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Run the tool"}]
)

for message in runner:
    tool_response = runner.generate_tool_call_response()

    if tool_response:
        # Check if any tool result has an error
        for block in tool_response.content:
            if block.is_error:
                # Option 1: Raise an exception to stop the loop
                raise RuntimeError(f"Tool failed: {json.dumps(block.content)}")

                # Option 2: Log and continue (let Claude handle it)

#### Modifying tool results

You can modify tool results before they're sent back to Claude. This is useful for adding metadata like `cache_control` to enable [prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) on tool results, or for transforming the tool output.

Use the tool response method to get the tool result, modify it, then add your modified version to the messages:

<Tip>
Adding `cache_control` to tool results is particularly useful when tools return large amounts of data (like document search results) that you want to cache for subsequent API calls. See [Prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) for more details on caching strategies.

    tools=[calculate_sum],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is 15 + 27?"}],
    stream=True
)

# When streaming, the runner returns BetaMessageStream
for message_stream in runner:
    for event in message_stream:
        print('event:', event)
    print('message:', message_stream.get_final_message())

print(runner.until_done())

## Controlling Claude's output

### Forcing tool use

In some cases, you may want Claude to use a specific tool to answer the user's question, even if Claude thinks it can provide an answer without using a tool. You can do this by specifying the tool in the `tool_choice` field like so:

```
tool_choice = {"type": "tool", "name": "get_weather"}
```

When working with the tool_choice parameter, we have four possible options:

- `auto` allows Claude to decide whether to call any provided tools or not. This is the default value when `tools` are provided.
- `any` tells Claude that it must use one of the provided tools, but doesn't force a particular tool.
- `tool` allows us to force Claude to always use a particular tool.
- `none` prevents Claude from using any tools. This is the default value when no `tools` are provided.

<Note>
When using [prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#what-invalidates-the-cache), changes to the `tool_choice` parameter will invalidate cached message blocks. Tool definitions and system prompts remain cached, but message content must be reprocessed.
</Note>

This diagram illustrates how each option works:

<Frame>
  ![Image](/docs/images/tool_choice.png)
</Frame>

Note that when you have `tool_choice` as `any` or `tool`, we will prefill the assistant message to force a tool to be used. This means that the models will not emit a natural language response or explanation before `tool_use` content blocks, even if explicitly asked to do so.

<Note>
When using [extended thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) with tool use, `tool_choice: {"type": "any"}` and `tool_choice: {"type": "tool", "name": "..."}` are not supported and will result in an error. Only `tool_choice: {"type": "auto"}` (the default) and `tool_choice: {"type": "none"}` are compatible with extended thinking.
</Note>

Our testing has shown that this should not reduce performance. If you would like the model to provide natural language context or explanations while still requesting that the model use a specific tool, you can use `{"type": "auto"}` for `tool_choice` (the default) and add explicit instructions in a `user` message. For example: `What's the weather like in London? Use the get_weather tool in your response.`

<Tip>
**Guaranteed tool calls with strict tools**

Combine `tool_choice: {"type": "any"}` with [strict tool use](/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs) to guarantee both that one of your tools will be called AND that the tool inputs strictly follow your schema. Set `strict: true` on your tool definitions to enable schema validation.
</Tip>

### JSON output

Tools do not necessarily need to be client functions — you can use tools anytime you want the model to return JSON output that follows a provided schema. For example, you might use a `record_summary` tool with a particular schema. See [Tool use with Claude](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview) for a full working example.

### Model responses with tools

When using tools, Claude will often comment on what it's doing or respond naturally to the user before invoking tools.

For example, given the prompt "What's the weather like in San Francisco right now, and what time is it there?", Claude might respond with:

```json JSON
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "I'll help you check the current weather and time in San Francisco."
    },
    {
      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9",
      "name": "get_weather",
      "input": {"location": "San Francisco, CA"}
    }
  ]
}
```

This natural response style helps users understand what Claude is doing and creates a more conversational interaction. You can guide the style and content of these responses through your system prompts and by providing `<examples>` in your prompts.

It's important to note that Claude may use various phrasings and approaches when explaining its actions. Your code should treat these responses like any other assistant-generated text, and not rely on specific formatting conventions.

### Parallel tool use

By default, Claude may use multiple tools to answer a user query. You can disable this behavior by:

- Setting `disable_parallel_tool_use=true` when tool_choice type is `auto`, which ensures that Claude uses **at most one** tool
- Setting `disable_parallel_tool_use=true` when tool_choice type is `any` or `tool`, which ensures that Claude uses **exactly one** tool

<section title="Complete parallel tool use example">

<Note>
**Simpler with Tool runner**: The example below shows manual parallel tool handling. For most use cases, [tool runner](#tool-runner-beta) automatically handle parallel tool execution with much less code.
</Note>

Here's a complete example showing how to properly format parallel tool calls in the message history:

#### Maximizing parallel tool use

While Claude 4 models have excellent parallel tool use capabilities by default, you can increase the likelihood of parallel tool execution across all models with targeted prompting:

<section title="System prompts for parallel tool use">

For Claude 4 models (Opus 4, and Sonnet 4), add this to your system prompt:
```text
For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
```

For even stronger parallel tool use (recommended if the default isn't sufficient), use:
```text
<use_parallel_tool_calls>
For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only commands like `ls` or `list_dir`, always run all of the commands in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.
</use_parallel_tool_calls>
```

</section>
<section title="User message prompting">

You can also encourage parallel tool use within specific user messages:

```python
# Instead of:
"What's the weather in Paris? Also check London."

# Use:
"Check the weather in Paris and London simultaneously."

# Or be explicit:
"Please use parallel tool calls to get the weather for Paris, London, and Tokyo at the same time."
```

</section>

<Warning>
**Parallel tool use with Claude Sonnet 3.7**

Claude Sonnet 3.7 may be less likely to make make parallel tool calls in a response, even when you have not set `disable_parallel_tool_use`. We recommend [upgrading to Claude 4 models](/docs/en/about-claude/models/migrating-to-claude-4), which have built-in token-efficient tool use and improved parallel tool calling.

If you're still using Claude Sonnet 3.7, you can enable the `token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19` [beta header](/docs/en/api/beta-headers), which helps encourage Claude to use parallel tools. You can also introduce a "batch tool" that can act as a meta-tool to wrap invocations to other tools simultaneously.

See [this example](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/tool-use-parallel-tools) in our cookbook for how to use this workaround.

</Warning>

## Handling tool use and tool result content blocks

<Note>
**Simpler with Tool runner**: The manual tool handling described in this section is automatically managed by [tool runner](#tool-runner-beta). Use this section when you need custom control over tool execution.
</Note>

Claude's response differs based on whether it uses a client or server tool.

### Handling results from client tools

The response will have a `stop_reason` of `tool_use` and one or more `tool_use` content blocks that include:

- `id`: A unique identifier for this particular tool use block. This will be used to match up the tool results later.
- `name`: The name of the tool being used.
- `input`: An object containing the input being passed to the tool, conforming to the tool's `input_schema`.

<section title="Example API response with a `tool_use` content block">

```json JSON
{
  "id": "msg_01Aq9w938a90dw8q",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "stop_reason": "tool_use",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "I'll check the current weather in San Francisco for you."
    },
    {
      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9",
      "name": "get_weather",
      "input": {"location": "San Francisco, CA", "unit": "celsius"}
    }
  ]
}
```

</section>

When you receive a tool use response for a client tool, you should:

1. Extract the `name`, `id`, and `input` from the `tool_use` block.
2. Run the actual tool in your codebase corresponding to that tool name, passing in the tool `input`.
3. Continue the conversation by sending a new message with the `role` of `user`, and a `content` block containing the `tool_result` type and the following information:
   - `tool_use_id`: The `id` of the tool use request this is a result for.
   - `content`: The result of the tool, as a string (e.g. `"content": "15 degrees"`), a list of nested content blocks (e.g. `"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "15 degrees"}]`), or a list of document blocks (e.g. `"content": ["type": "document", "source": {"type": "text", "media_type": "text/plain", "data": "15 degrees"}]`). These content blocks can use the `text`, `image`, or `document` types.
   - `is_error` (optional): Set to `true` if the tool execution resulted in an error.

<Note>
**Important formatting requirements**:
- Tool result blocks must immediately follow their corresponding tool use blocks in the message history. You cannot include any messages between the assistant's tool use message and the user's tool result message.
- In the user message containing tool results, the tool_result blocks must come FIRST in the content array. Any text must come AFTER all tool results.

For example, this will cause a 400 error:
```json
{"role": "user", "content": [
  {"type": "text", "text": "Here are the results:"},  // ❌ Text before tool_result
  {"type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": "toolu_01", ...}
]}
```

This is correct:
```json
{"role": "user", "content": [
  {"type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": "toolu_01", ...},
  {"type": "text", "text": "What should I do next?"}  // ✅ Text after tool_result
]}
```

If you receive an error like "tool_use ids were found without tool_result blocks immediately after", check that your tool results are formatted correctly.

      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</section>

After receiving the tool result, Claude will use that information to continue generating a response to the original user prompt.

### Handling results from server tools

Claude executes the tool internally and incorporates the results directly into its response without requiring additional user interaction.

<Tip>
  **Differences from other APIs**

Unlike APIs that separate tool use or use special roles like `tool` or `function`, the Claude API integrates tools directly into the `user` and `assistant` message structure.

Messages contain arrays of `text`, `image`, `tool_use`, and `tool_result` blocks. `user` messages include client content and `tool_result`, while `assistant` messages contain AI-generated content and `tool_use`.

</Tip>

### Handling the `max_tokens` stop reason

If Claude's [response is cut off due to hitting the `max_tokens` limit](/docs/en/build-with-claude/handling-stop-reasons#max-tokens), and the truncated response contains an incomplete tool use block, you'll need to retry the request with a higher `max_tokens` value to get the full tool use.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Check if response was truncated during tool use
if response.stop_reason == "max_tokens":
    # Check if the last content block is an incomplete tool_use
    last_block = response.content[-1]
    if last_block.type == "tool_use":
        # Send the request with higher max_tokens
        response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
            max_tokens=4096,  # Increased limit
            messages=messages,
            tools=tools
        )
```

```typescript TypeScript
// Check if response was truncated during tool use
if (response.stop_reason === "max_tokens") {
  // Check if the last content block is an incomplete tool_use
  const lastBlock = response.content[response.content.length - 1];
  if (lastBlock.type === "tool_use") {
    // Send the request with higher max_tokens
    response = await anthropic.messages.create({
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-5",
      max_tokens: 4096, // Increased limit
      messages: messages,
      tools: tools
    });
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Handling the `pause_turn` stop reason

When using server tools like web search, the API may return a `pause_turn` stop reason, indicating that the API has paused a long-running turn.

Here's how to handle the `pause_turn` stop reason:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Initial request with web search
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Search for comprehensive information about quantum computing breakthroughs in 2025"
        }
    ],
    tools=[{
        "type": "web_search_20250305",
        "name": "web_search",
        "max_uses": 10
    }]
)

# Check if the response has pause_turn stop reason
if response.stop_reason == "pause_turn":
    # Continue the conversation with the paused content
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Search for comprehensive information about quantum computing breakthroughs in 2025"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": response.content}
    ]

    # Send the continuation request
    continuation = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=messages,
        tools=[{
            "type": "web_search_20250305",
            "name": "web_search",
            "max_uses": 10

# SECTION 4: Agent SDK Overview

# Agent SDK overview

Build production AI agents with Claude Code as a library

---

<Note>
The Claude Code SDK has been renamed to the Claude Agent SDK. If you're migrating from the old SDK, see the [Migration Guide](/docs/en/agent-sdk/migration-guide).
</Note>

Build AI agents that autonomously read files, run commands, search the web, edit code, and more. The Agent SDK gives you the same tools, agent loop, and context management that power Claude Code, programmable in Python and TypeScript.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

async def main():
    async for message in query(
        prompt="Find and fix the bug in auth.py",
        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=["Read", "Edit", "Bash"])
    ):
        print(message)  # Claude reads the file, finds the bug, edits it

asyncio.run(main())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Find and fix the bug in auth.py",
  options: { allowedTools: ["Read", "Edit", "Bash"] }
})) {
  console.log(message);  // Claude reads the file, finds the bug, edits it
}
```
</CodeGroup>

The Agent SDK includes built-in tools for reading files, running commands, and editing code, so your agent can start working immediately without you implementing tool execution. Dive into the quickstart or explore real agents built with the SDK:

## Capabilities

Everything that makes Claude Code powerful is available in the SDK:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Built-in tools">
    Your agent can read files, run commands, and search codebases out of the box. Key tools include:

    | Tool | What it does |
    |------|--------------|
    | **Read** | Read any file in the working directory |
    | **Write** | Create new files |
    | **Edit** | Make precise edits to existing files |
    | **Bash** | Run terminal commands, scripts, git operations |
    | **Glob** | Find files by pattern (`**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.py`) |
    | **Grep** | Search file contents with regex |
    | **WebSearch** | Search the web for current information |
    | **WebFetch** | Fetch and parse web page content |
    | **[AskUserQuestion](/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input#handle-clarifying-questions)** | Ask the user clarifying questions with multiple choice options |

    This example creates an agent that searches your codebase for TODO comments:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import asyncio
    from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

    async def main():
        async for message in query(
            prompt="Find all TODO comments and create a summary",
            options=ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=["Read", "Glob", "Grep"])
        ):
            if hasattr(message, "result"):
                print(message.result)

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

    for await (const message of query({
      prompt: "Find all TODO comments and create a summary",
      options: { allowedTools: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep"] }
    })) {
      if ("result" in message) console.log(message.result);
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hooks">
    Run custom code at key points in the agent lifecycle. SDK hooks use callback functions to validate, log, block, or transform agent behavior.

    **Available hooks:** `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and more.

    This example logs all file changes to an audit file:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import asyncio
    from datetime import datetime
    from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, HookMatcher

    async def log_file_change(input_data, tool_use_id, context):
        file_path = input_data.get('tool_input', {}).get('file_path', 'unknown')
        with open('./audit.log', 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"{datetime.now()}: modified {file_path}\n")
        return {}

    async def main():
        async for message in query(
            prompt="Refactor utils.py to improve readability",
            options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
                permission_mode="acceptEdits",
                hooks={
                    "PostToolUse": [HookMatcher(matcher="Edit|Write", hooks=[log_file_change])]
                }
            )
        ):
            if hasattr(message, "result"):
                print(message.result)

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { query, HookCallback } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";
    import { appendFileSync } from "fs";

    const logFileChange: HookCallback = async (input) => {
      const filePath = (input as any).tool_input?.file_path ?? "unknown";
      appendFileSync("./audit.log", `${new Date().toISOString()}: modified ${filePath}\n`);
      return {};
    };

    for await (const message of query({
      prompt: "Refactor utils.py to improve readability",
      options: {
        permissionMode: "acceptEdits",
        hooks: {
          PostToolUse: [{ matcher: "Edit|Write", hooks: [logFileChange] }]
        }
      }
    })) {
      if ("result" in message) console.log(message.result);
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    [Learn more about hooks →](/docs/en/agent-sdk/hooks)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Subagents">
    Spawn specialized agents to handle focused subtasks. Your main agent delegates work, and subagents report back with results.

    Define custom agents with specialized instructions. Include `Task` in `allowedTools` since subagents are invoked via the Task tool:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import asyncio
    from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, AgentDefinition

    async def main():
        async for message in query(
            prompt="Use the code-reviewer agent to review this codebase",
            options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
                allowed_tools=["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "Task"],
                agents={
                    "code-reviewer": AgentDefinition(
                        description="Expert code reviewer for quality and security reviews.",
                        prompt="Analyze code quality and suggest improvements.",
                        tools=["Read", "Glob", "Grep"]
                    )
                }
            )
        ):
            if hasattr(message, "result"):
                print(message.result)

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

    for await (const message of query({
      prompt: "Use the code-reviewer agent to review this codebase",
      options: {
        allowedTools: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "Task"],
        agents: {
          "code-reviewer": {
            description: "Expert code reviewer for quality and security reviews.",
            prompt: "Analyze code quality and suggest improvements.",
            tools: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep"]
          }
        }
      }
    })) {
      if ("result" in message) console.log(message.result);
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Messages from within a subagent's context include a `parent_tool_use_id` field, letting you track which messages belong to which subagent execution.

    [Learn more about subagents →](/docs/en/agent-sdk/subagents)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="MCP">
    Connect to external systems via the Model Context Protocol: databases, browsers, APIs, and [hundreds more](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).

    This example connects the [Playwright MCP server](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) to give your agent browser automation capabilities:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import asyncio
    from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

    async def main():
        async for message in query(
            prompt="Open example.com and describe what you see",
            options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
                mcp_servers={
                    "playwright": {"command": "npx", "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]}
                }

        }
      }
    })) {
      if ("result" in message) console.log(message.result);
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    [Learn more about MCP →](/docs/en/agent-sdk/mcp)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Permissions">
    Control exactly which tools your agent can use. Allow safe operations, block dangerous ones, or require approval for sensitive actions.

    <Note>
    For interactive approval prompts and the `AskUserQuestion` tool, see [Handle approvals and user input](/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input).
    </Note>

    This example creates a read-only agent that can analyze but not modify code:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import asyncio
    from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

    async def main():
        async for message in query(

            )
        ):
            if hasattr(message, "result"):
                print(message.result)

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sessions">
    Maintain context across multiple exchanges. Claude remembers files read, analysis done, and conversation history. Resume sessions later, or fork them to explore different approaches.

    This example captures the session ID from the first query, then resumes to continue with full context:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import asyncio
    from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

    async def main():
        session_id = None

        # First query: capture the session ID
        async for message in query(
            prompt="Read the authentication module",
            options=ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=["Read", "Glob"])
        ):
            if hasattr(message, 'subtype') and message.subtype == 'init':
                session_id = message.session_id

        # Resume with full context from the first query
        async for message in query(
            prompt="Now find all places that call it",  # "it" = auth module
            options=ClaudeAgentOptions(resume=session_id)
        ):
            if hasattr(message, "result"):

## Compare the Agent SDK to other Claude tools

The Claude platform offers multiple ways to build with Claude. Here's how the Agent SDK fits in:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Agent SDK vs Client SDK">
    The [Anthropic Client SDK](/docs/en/api/client-sdks) gives you direct API access: you send prompts and implement tool execution yourself. The **Agent SDK** gives you Claude with built-in tool execution.

    With the Client SDK, you implement a tool loop. With the Agent SDK, Claude handles it:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    # Client SDK: You implement the tool loop
    response = client.messages.create(...)
    while response.stop_reason == "tool_use":
        result = your_tool_executor(response.tool_use)
        response = client.messages.create(tool_result=result, ...)

    # Agent SDK: Claude handles tools autonomously
    async for message in query(prompt="Fix the bug in auth.py"):
        print(message)
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    // Client SDK: You implement the tool loop
    let response = await client.messages.create({...});
    while (response.stop_reason === "tool_use") {
      const result = yourToolExecutor(response.tool_use);
      response = await client.messages.create({ tool_result: result, ... });
    }

    // Agent SDK: Claude handles tools autonomously
    for await (const message of query({ prompt: "Fix the bug in auth.py" })) {
      console.log(message);
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Agent SDK vs Claude Code CLI">
    Same capabilities, different interface:

    | Use case | Best choice |
    |----------|-------------|
    | Interactive development | CLI |
    | CI/CD pipelines | SDK |
    | Custom applications | SDK |
    | One-off tasks | CLI |
    | Production automation | SDK |

    Many teams use both: CLI for daily development, SDK for production. Workflows translate directly between them.

## Branding guidelines

For partners integrating the Claude Agent SDK, use of Claude branding is optional. When referencing Claude in your product:

**Allowed:**
- "Claude Agent" (preferred for dropdown menus)
- "Claude" (when within a menu already labeled "Agents")
- "{YourAgentName} Powered by Claude" (if you have an existing agent name)

**Not permitted:**
- "Claude Code" or "Claude Code Agent"
- Claude Code-branded ASCII art or visual elements that mimic Claude Code

Your product should maintain its own branding and not appear to be Claude Code or any Anthropic product. For questions about branding compliance, contact our [sales team](https://www.anthropic.com/contact-sales).

## License and terms

Use of the Claude Agent SDK is governed by [Anthropic's Commercial Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms), including when you use it to power products and services that you make available to your own customers and end users, except to the extent a specific component or dependency is covered by a different license as indicated in that component's LICENSE file.

  <Step title="Create a project folder">
    Create a new directory for this quickstart:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-agent && cd my-agent
    ```

    For your own projects, you can run the SDK from any folder; it will have access to files in that directory and its subdirectories by default.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Install the Agent SDK package for your language:

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your API key">
    If you've already authenticated Claude Code (by running `claude` in your terminal), the SDK uses that authentication automatically.

    Otherwise, you need an API key, which you can get from the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/).

    Create a `.env` file in your project directory and store the API key there:

    ```bash
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```

    **Using Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Azure?** See the setup guides for [Bedrock](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/amazon-bedrock), [Vertex AI](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/google-vertex-ai), or [Azure AI Foundry](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/azure-ai-foundry).

    Unless previously approved, Anthropic does not allow third party developers to offer claude.ai login or rate limits for their products, including agents built on the Claude Agent SDK. Please use the API key authentication methods described in this document instead.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a buggy file

This quickstart walks you through building an agent that can find and fix bugs in code. First, you need a file with some intentional bugs for the agent to fix. Create `utils.py` in the `my-agent` directory and paste the following code:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

def get_user_name(user):
    return user["name"].upper()
```

This code has two bugs:
1. `calculate_average([])` crashes with division by zero
2. `get_user_name(None)` crashes with a TypeError

## Choosing Between `query()` and `ClaudeSDKClient`

The Python SDK provides two ways to interact with Claude Code:

### Quick Comparison

| Feature             | `query()`                     | `ClaudeSDKClient`                  |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **Session**         | Creates new session each time | Reuses same session                |
| **Conversation**    | Single exchange               | Multiple exchanges in same context |
| **Connection**      | Managed automatically         | Manual control                     |
| **Streaming Input** | ✅ Supported                  | ✅ Supported                       |
| **Interrupts**      | ❌ Not supported              | ✅ Supported                       |
| **Hooks**           | ❌ Not supported              | ✅ Supported                       |
| **Custom Tools**    | ❌ Not supported              | ✅ Supported                       |
| **Continue Chat**   | ❌ New session each time      | ✅ Maintains conversation          |
| **Use Case**        | One-off tasks                 | Continuous conversations           |

### When to Use `query()` (New Session Each Time)

**Best for:**

- One-off questions where you don't need conversation history
- Independent tasks that don't require context from previous exchanges
- Simple automation scripts
- When you want a fresh start each time

### When to Use `ClaudeSDKClient` (Continuous Conversation)

**Best for:**

- **Continuing conversations** - When you need Claude to remember context
- **Follow-up questions** - Building on previous responses
- **Interactive applications** - Chat interfaces, REPLs
- **Response-driven logic** - When next action depends on Claude's response
- **Session control** - Managing conversation lifecycle explicitly

## Functions

### `query()`

Creates a new session for each interaction with Claude Code. Returns an async iterator that yields messages as they arrive. Each call to `query()` starts fresh with no memory of previous interactions.

```python
async def query(
    *,
    prompt: str | AsyncIterable[dict[str, Any]],
    options: ClaudeAgentOptions | None = None
) -> AsyncIterator[Message]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type                         | Description                                                                |
| :-------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prompt`  | `str \| AsyncIterable[dict]` | The input prompt as a string or async iterable for streaming mode          |
| `options` | `ClaudeAgentOptions \| None` | Optional configuration object (defaults to `ClaudeAgentOptions()` if None) |

#### Returns

Returns an `AsyncIterator[Message]` that yields messages from the conversation.

#### Example - With options

```python

import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

async def main():
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        system_prompt="You are an expert Python developer",
        permission_mode='acceptEdits',
        cwd="/home/user/project"
    )

    async for message in query(
        prompt="Create a Python web server",
        options=options
    ):
        print(message)


asyncio.run(main())
```

### `tool()`

Decorator for defining MCP tools with type safety.

```python
def tool(
    name: str,
    description: str,
    input_schema: type | dict[str, Any]
) -> Callable[[Callable[[Any], Awaitable[dict[str, Any]]]], SdkMcpTool[Any]]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter      | Type                     | Description                                             |
| :------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`         | `str`                    | Unique identifier for the tool                          |
| `description`  | `str`                    | Human-readable description of what the tool does        |
| `input_schema` | `type \| dict[str, Any]` | Schema defining the tool's input parameters (see below) |

#### Input Schema Options

1. **Simple type mapping** (recommended):

   ```python
   {"text": str, "count": int, "enabled": bool}
   ```

2. **JSON Schema format** (for complex validation):
   ```python
   {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
           "text": {"type": "string"},
           "count": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0}
       },
       "required": ["text"]
   }
   ```

#### Returns

A decorator function that wraps the tool implementation and returns an `SdkMcpTool` instance.

#### Example

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import tool
from typing import Any

@tool("greet", "Greet a user", {"name": str})
async def greet(args: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        "content": [{
            "type": "text",
            "text": f"Hello, {args['name']}!"
        }]
    }
```

### `create_sdk_mcp_server()`

Create an in-process MCP server that runs within your Python application.

```python
def create_sdk_mcp_server(
    name: str,
    version: str = "1.0.0",
    tools: list[SdkMcpTool[Any]] | None = None
) -> McpSdkServerConfig
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type                            | Default   | Description                                           |
| :-------- | :------------------------------ | :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`    | `str`                           | -         | Unique identifier for the server                      |
| `version` | `str`                           | `"1.0.0"` | Server version string                                 |
| `tools`   | `list[SdkMcpTool[Any]] \| None` | `None`    | List of tool functions created with `@tool` decorator |

#### Returns

Returns an `McpSdkServerConfig` object that can be passed to `ClaudeAgentOptions.mcp_servers`.

#### Example

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import tool, create_sdk_mcp_server

@tool("add", "Add two numbers", {"a": float, "b": float})
async def add(args):
    return {
        "content": [{
            "type": "text",
            "text": f"Sum: {args['a'] + args['b']}"
        }]
    }

@tool("multiply", "Multiply two numbers", {"a": float, "b": float})
async def multiply(args):
    return {
        "content": [{
            "type": "text",
            "text": f"Product: {args['a'] * args['b']}"
        }]
    }

calculator = create_sdk_mcp_server(
    name="calculator",
    version="2.0.0",
    tools=[add, multiply]  # Pass decorated functions
)

# Use with Claude
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    mcp_servers={"calc": calculator},
    allowed_tools=["mcp__calc__add", "mcp__calc__multiply"]
)
```

## Classes

### `ClaudeSDKClient`

**Maintains a conversation session across multiple exchanges.** This is the Python equivalent of how the TypeScript SDK's `query()` function works internally - it creates a client object that can continue conversations.

#### Key Features

- **Session Continuity**: Maintains conversation context across multiple `query()` calls
- **Same Conversation**: Claude remembers previous messages in the session
- **Interrupt Support**: Can stop Claude mid-execution
- **Explicit Lifecycle**: You control when the session starts and ends
- **Response-driven Flow**: Can react to responses and send follow-ups
- **Custom Tools & Hooks**: Supports custom tools (created with `@tool` decorator) and hooks

```python
class ClaudeSDKClient:
    def __init__(self, options: ClaudeAgentOptions | None = None)
    async def connect(self, prompt: str | AsyncIterable[dict] | None = None) -> None
    async def query(self, prompt: str | AsyncIterable[dict], session_id: str = "default") -> None
    async def receive_messages(self) -> AsyncIterator[Message]
    async def receive_response(self) -> AsyncIterator[Message]
    async def interrupt(self) -> None
    async def rewind_files(self, user_message_uuid: str) -> None
    async def disconnect(self) -> None
```

#### Methods

| Method                      | Description                                                         |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `__init__(options)`         | Initialize the client with optional configuration                   |
| `connect(prompt)`           | Connect to Claude with an optional initial prompt or message stream |
| `query(prompt, session_id)` | Send a new request in streaming mode                                |
| `receive_messages()`        | Receive all messages from Claude as an async iterator               |
| `receive_response()`        | Receive messages until and including a ResultMessage                |
| `interrupt()`               | Send interrupt signal (only works in streaming mode)                |
| `rewind_files(user_message_uuid)` | Restore files to their state at the specified user message. Requires `enable_file_checkpointing=True`. See [File checkpointing](/docs/en/agent-sdk/file-checkpointing) |
| `disconnect()`              | Disconnect from Claude                                              |

#### Context Manager Support

The client can be used as an async context manager for automatic connection management:

```python
async with ClaudeSDKClient() as client:
    await client.query("Hello Claude")
    async for message in client.receive_response():
        print(message)
```

> **Important:** When iterating over messages, avoid using `break` to exit early as this can cause asyncio cleanup issues. Instead, let the iteration complete naturally or use flags to track when you've found what you need.

#### Example - Continuing a conversation

```python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, AssistantMessage, TextBlock, ResultMessage

async def main():
    async with ClaudeSDKClient() as client:
        # First question
        await client.query("What's the capital of France?")

        # Process response
        async for message in client.receive_response():
            if isinstance(message, AssistantMessage):
                for block in message.content:
                    if isinstance(block, TextBlock):
                        print(f"Claude: {block.text}")

        # Follow-up question - Claude remembers the previous context
        await client.query("What's the population of that city?")

        async for message in client.receive_response():
            if isinstance(message, AssistantMessage):
                for block in message.content:
                    if isinstance(block, TextBlock):
                        print(f"Claude: {block.text}")

        # Another follow-up - still in the same conversation
        await client.query("What are some famous landmarks there?")

        async for message in client.receive_response():
            if isinstance(message, AssistantMessage):
                for block in message.content:
                    if isinstance(block, TextBlock):
                        print(f"Claude: {block.text}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Example - Streaming input with ClaudeSDKClient

```python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient

async def message_stream():
    """Generate messages dynamically."""
    yield {"type": "text", "text": "Analyze the following data:"}
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
    yield {"type": "text", "text": "Temperature: 25°C"}
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
    yield {"type": "text", "text": "Humidity: 60%"}
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
    yield {"type": "text", "text": "What patterns do you see?"}

async def main():
    async with ClaudeSDKClient() as client:
        # Stream input to Claude
        await client.query(message_stream())

        # Process response
        async for message in client.receive_response():
            print(message)

        # Follow-up in same session
        await client.query("Should we be concerned about these readings?")

        async for message in client.receive_response():
            print(message)

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Example - Using interrupts

```python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, ClaudeAgentOptions

async def interruptible_task():
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        allowed_tools=["Bash"],
        permission_mode="acceptEdits"
    )

    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
        # Start a long-running task
        await client.query("Count from 1 to 100 slowly")

        # Let it run for a bit
        await asyncio.sleep(2)

        # Interrupt the task
        await client.interrupt()
        print("Task interrupted!")

        # Send a new command
        await client.query("Just say hello instead")

        async for message in client.receive_response():
            # Process the new response
            pass

asyncio.run(interruptible_task())
```

#### Example - Advanced permission control

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import (
    ClaudeSDKClient,
    ClaudeAgentOptions
)
from claude_agent_sdk.types import PermissionResultAllow, PermissionResultDeny

async def custom_permission_handler(
    tool_name: str,
    input_data: dict,
    context: dict
) -> PermissionResultAllow | PermissionResultDeny:
    """Custom logic for tool permissions."""

    # Block writes to system directories
    if tool_name == "Write" and input_data.get("file_path", "").startswith("/system/"):
        return PermissionResultDeny(
            message="System directory write not allowed",
            interrupt=True
        )

    # Redirect sensitive file operations
    if tool_name in ["Write", "Edit"] and "config" in input_data.get("file_path", ""):
        safe_path = f"./sandbox/{input_data['file_path']}"
        return PermissionResultAllow(
            updated_input={**input_data, "file_path": safe_path}
        )

    # Allow everything else
    return PermissionResultAllow(updated_input=input_data)

async def main():
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        can_use_tool=custom_permission_handler,
        allowed_tools=["Read", "Write", "Edit"]
    )

    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
        await client.query("Update the system config file")

        async for message in client.receive_response():
            # Will use sandbox path instead
            print(message)

asyncio.run(main())
```

| :---------- | :------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| `"user"`    | Global user settings                         | `~/.claude/settings.json`     |
| `"project"` | Shared project settings (version controlled) | `.claude/settings.json`       |
| `"local"`   | Local project settings (gitignored)          | `.claude/settings.local.json` |

#### Default behavior

When `setting_sources` is **omitted** or **`None`**, the SDK does **not** load any filesystem settings. This provides isolation for SDK applications.

#### Why use setting_sources?

**Load all filesystem settings (legacy behavior):**

```python
# Load all settings like SDK v0.0.x did
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

async for message in query(
    prompt="Analyze this code",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        setting_sources=["user", "project", "local"]  # Load all settings
    )
):
    print(message)
```

**Load only specific setting sources:**

```python
# Load only project settings, ignore user and local
async for message in query(
    prompt="Run CI checks",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        setting_sources=["project"]  # Only .claude/settings.json
    )
):
    print(message)
```

**Testing and CI environments:**

```python
# Ensure consistent behavior in CI by excluding local settings
async for message in query(
    prompt="Run tests",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        setting_sources=["project"],  # Only team-shared settings
        permission_mode="bypassPermissions"
    )
):
    print(message)
```

**SDK-only applications:**

```python
# Define everything programmatically (default behavior)
# No filesystem dependencies - setting_sources defaults to None
async for message in query(
    prompt="Review this PR",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        # setting_sources=None is the default, no need to specify
        agents={ /* ... */ },
        mcp_servers={ /* ... */ },
        allowed_tools=["Read", "Grep", "Glob"]
    )
):
    print(message)
```

**Loading CLAUDE.md project instructions:**

```python
# Load project settings to include CLAUDE.md files
async for message in query(
    prompt="Add a new feature following project conventions",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        system_prompt={
            "type": "preset",
            "preset": "claude_code"  # Use Claude Code's system prompt
        },
        setting_sources=["project"],  # Required to load CLAUDE.md from project
        allowed_tools=["Read", "Write", "Edit"]
    )
):
    print(message)
```

#### Settings precedence

When multiple sources are loaded, settings are merged with this precedence (highest to lowest):

1. Local settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
2. Project settings (`.claude/settings.json`)
3. User settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)

Programmatic options (like `agents`, `allowed_tools`) always override filesystem settings.

### `AgentDefinition`

| `model`       | No       | Model override for this agent. If omitted, uses the main model |

### `PermissionMode`

Permission modes for controlling tool execution.

```python
PermissionMode = Literal[
    "default",           # Standard permission behavior
    "acceptEdits",       # Auto-accept file edits

```python
CanUseTool = Callable[
    [str, dict[str, Any], ToolPermissionContext],

]
```

### Hook Usage Example

This example registers two hooks: one that blocks dangerous bash commands like `rm -rf /`, and another that logs all tool usage for auditing. The security hook only runs on Bash commands (via the `matcher`), while the logging hook runs on all tools.

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, HookMatcher, HookContext
from typing import Any

async def validate_bash_command(
    input_data: dict[str, Any],
    tool_use_id: str | None,
    context: HookContext
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Validate and potentially block dangerous bash commands."""
    if input_data['tool_name'] == 'Bash':
        command = input_data['tool_input'].get('command', '')
        if 'rm -rf /' in command:
            return {
                'hookSpecificOutput': {
                    'hookEventName': 'PreToolUse',
                    'permissionDecision': 'deny',
                    'permissionDecisionReason': 'Dangerous command blocked'
                }
            }
    return {}

async def log_tool_use(
    input_data: dict[str, Any],
    tool_use_id: str | None,
    context: HookContext
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Log all tool usage for auditing."""
    print(f"Tool used: {input_data.get('tool_name')}")
    return {}

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    hooks={
        'PreToolUse': [
            HookMatcher(matcher='Bash', hooks=[validate_bash_command], timeout=120),  # 2 min for validation
            HookMatcher(hooks=[log_tool_use])  # Applies to all tools (default 60s timeout)
        ],
        'PostToolUse': [
            HookMatcher(hooks=[log_tool_use])
        ]
    }
)

async for message in query(
    prompt="Analyze this codebase",
    options=options
):
    print(message)
```

## Tool Input/Output Types

Documentation of input/output schemas for all built-in Claude Code tools. While the Python SDK doesn't export these as types, they represent the structure of tool inputs and outputs in messages.

### Task

**Tool name:** `Task`

**Input:**

```python
{
    "description": str,      # A short (3-5 word) description of the task
    "prompt": str,           # The task for the agent to perform
    "subagent_type": str     # The type of specialized agent to use
}
```

**Output:**

```python
{
    "result": str,                    # Final result from the subagent

## Sandbox Configuration

### `SandboxSettings`

Configuration for sandbox behavior. Use this to enable command sandboxing and configure network restrictions programmatically.

```python
class SandboxSettings(TypedDict, total=False):
    enabled: bool
    autoAllowBashIfSandboxed: bool
    excludedCommands: list[str]
    allowUnsandboxedCommands: bool
    network: SandboxNetworkConfig
    ignoreViolations: SandboxIgnoreViolations
    enableWeakerNestedSandbox: bool
```

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `False` | Enable sandbox mode for command execution |
| `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed` | `bool` | `False` | Auto-approve bash commands when sandbox is enabled |
| `excludedCommands` | `list[str]` | `[]` | Commands that always bypass sandbox restrictions (e.g., `["docker"]`). These run unsandboxed automatically without model involvement |
| `allowUnsandboxedCommands` | `bool` | `False` | Allow the model to request running commands outside the sandbox. When `True`, the model can set `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` in tool input, which falls back to the [permissions system](#permissions-fallback-for-unsandboxed-commands) |
| `network` | [`SandboxNetworkConfig`](#sandboxnetworkconfig) | `None` | Network-specific sandbox configuration |
| `ignoreViolations` | [`SandboxIgnoreViolations`](#sandboxignoreviolations) | `None` | Configure which sandbox violations to ignore |
| `enableWeakerNestedSandbox` | `bool` | `False` | Enable a weaker nested sandbox for compatibility |

<Note>
**Filesystem and network access restrictions** are NOT configured via sandbox settings. Instead, they are derived from [permission rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#permission-settings):

- **Filesystem read restrictions**: Read deny rules
- **Filesystem write restrictions**: Edit allow/deny rules
- **Network restrictions**: WebFetch allow/deny rules

Use sandbox settings for command execution sandboxing, and permission rules for filesystem and network access control.
</Note>

#### Example usage

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, SandboxSettings

sandbox_settings: SandboxSettings = {
    "enabled": True,
    "autoAllowBashIfSandboxed": True,
    "network": {
        "allowLocalBinding": True
    }
}

async for message in query(
    prompt="Build and test my project",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(sandbox=sandbox_settings)
):
    print(message)
```

<Warning>
**Unix socket security**: The `allowUnixSockets` option can grant access to powerful system services. For example, allowing `/var/run/docker.sock` effectively grants full host system access through the Docker API, bypassing sandbox isolation. Only allow Unix sockets that are strictly necessary and understand the security implications of each.
</Warning>

### `SandboxNetworkConfig`

Network-specific configuration for sandbox mode.

```python
class SandboxNetworkConfig(TypedDict, total=False):
    allowLocalBinding: bool
    allowUnixSockets: list[str]
    allowAllUnixSockets: bool
    httpProxyPort: int
    socksProxyPort: int
```

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| `allowLocalBinding` | `bool` | `False` | Allow processes to bind to local ports (e.g., for dev servers) |
| `allowUnixSockets` | `list[str]` | `[]` | Unix socket paths that processes can access (e.g., Docker socket) |
| `allowAllUnixSockets` | `bool` | `False` | Allow access to all Unix sockets |
| `httpProxyPort` | `int` | `None` | HTTP proxy port for network requests |
| `socksProxyPort` | `int` | `None` | SOCKS proxy port for network requests |

### `SandboxIgnoreViolations`

Configuration for ignoring specific sandbox violations.

```python
class SandboxIgnoreViolations(TypedDict, total=False):
    file: list[str]
    network: list[str]
```

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| `file` | `list[str]` | `[]` | File path patterns to ignore violations for |
| `network` | `list[str]` | `[]` | Network patterns to ignore violations for |

### Permissions Fallback for Unsandboxed Commands

When `allowUnsandboxedCommands` is enabled, the model can request to run commands outside the sandbox by setting `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: True` in the tool input. These requests fall back to the existing permissions system, meaning your `can_use_tool` handler will be invoked, allowing you to implement custom authorization logic.

<Note>
**`excludedCommands` vs `allowUnsandboxedCommands`:**
- `excludedCommands`: A static list of commands that always bypass the sandbox automatically (e.g., `["docker"]`). The model has no control over this.
- `allowUnsandboxedCommands`: Lets the model decide at runtime whether to request unsandboxed execution by setting `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: True` in the tool input.
</Note>

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

async def can_use_tool(tool: str, input: dict) -> bool:
    # Check if the model is requesting to bypass the sandbox
    if tool == "Bash" and input.get("dangerouslyDisableSandbox"):
        # The model wants to run this command outside the sandbox
        print(f"Unsandboxed command requested: {input.get('command')}")

        # Return True to allow, False to deny
        return is_command_authorized(input.get("command"))
    return True

async def main():
    async for message in query(
        prompt="Deploy my application",
        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
            sandbox={
                "enabled": True,
                "allowUnsandboxedCommands": True  # Model can request unsandboxed execution
            },
            permission_mode="default",
            can_use_tool=can_use_tool
        )
    ):
        print(message)
```

This pattern enables you to:

- **Audit model requests**: Log when the model requests unsandboxed execution
- **Implement allowlists**: Only permit specific commands to run unsandboxed
- **Add approval workflows**: Require explicit authorization for privileged operations

<Warning>
Commands running with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: True` have full system access. Ensure your `can_use_tool` handler validates these requests carefully.

If `permission_mode` is set to `bypassPermissions` and `allow_unsandboxed_commands` is enabled, the model can autonomously execute commands outside the sandbox without any approval prompts. This combination effectively allows the model to escape sandbox isolation silently.
</Warning>

# SECTION 6: Extended Thinking

# Building with extended thinking

---

Extended thinking gives Claude enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks, while providing varying levels of transparency into its step-by-step thought process before it delivers its final answer.

## Supported models

Extended thinking is supported in the following models:

- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)
- Claude Sonnet 4 (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
- Claude Sonnet 3.7 (`claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`) ([deprecated](/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations))
- Claude Haiku 4.5 (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`)
- Claude Opus 4.5 (`claude-opus-4-5-20251101`)
- Claude Opus 4.1 (`claude-opus-4-1-20250805`)
- Claude Opus 4 (`claude-opus-4-20250514`)

<Note>
API behavior differs across Claude Sonnet 3.7 and Claude 4 models, but the API shapes remain exactly the same.

For more information, see [Differences in thinking across model versions](#differences-in-thinking-across-model-versions).
</Note>

## How extended thinking works

When extended thinking is turned on, Claude creates `thinking` content blocks where it outputs its internal reasoning. Claude incorporates insights from this reasoning before crafting a final response.

The API response will include `thinking` content blocks, followed by `text` content blocks.

Here's an example of the default response format:

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "thinking",
      "thinking": "Let me analyze this step by step...",
      "signature": "WaUjzkypQ2mUEVM36O2TxuC06KN8xyfbJwyem2dw3URve/op91XWHOEBLLqIOMfFG/UvLEczmEsUjavL...."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Based on my analysis..."
    }
  ]
}
```

For more information about the response format of extended thinking, see the [Messages API Reference](/docs/en/api/messages).

## How to use extended thinking

Here is an example of using extended thinking in the Messages API:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Shell
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
     --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
     --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
     --header "content-type: application/json" \
     --data \
'{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "max_tokens": 16000,
    "thinking": {
        "type": "enabled",
        "budget_tokens": 10000
    },
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Are there an infinite number of prime numbers such that n mod 4 == 3?"
        }
    ]
}'
```

```python Python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=16000,
    thinking={
        "type": "enabled",
        "budget_tokens": 10000
    },
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Are there an infinite number of prime numbers such that n mod 4 == 3?"
    }]
)

# The response will contain summarized thinking blocks and text blocks
for block in response.content:
    if block.type == "thinking":
        print(f"\nThinking summary: {block.thinking}")
    elif block.type == "text":
        print(f"\nResponse: {block.text}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const client = new Anthropic();

const response = await client.messages.create({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  max_tokens: 16000,
  thinking: {
    type: "enabled",
    budget_tokens: 10000
  },
  messages: [{
    role: "user",
    content: "Are there an infinite number of prime numbers such that n mod 4 == 3?"
  }]
});

// The response will contain summarized thinking blocks and text blocks
for (const block of response.content) {
  if (block.type === "thinking") {
    console.log(`\nThinking summary: ${block.thinking}`);
  } else if (block.type === "text") {
    console.log(`\nResponse: ${block.text}`);
  }
}
```

```java Java
import com.anthropic.client.AnthropicClient;
import com.anthropic.client.okhttp.AnthropicOkHttpClient;
import com.anthropic.models.beta.messages.*;
import com.anthropic.models.beta.messages.MessageCreateParams;
import com.anthropic.models.messages.*;

public class SimpleThinkingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnthropicClient client = AnthropicOkHttpClient.fromEnv();

        BetaMessage response = client.beta().messages().create(
                MessageCreateParams.builder()
                        .model(Model.CLAUDE_OPUS_4_0)
                        .maxTokens(16000)
                        .thinking(BetaThinkingConfigEnabled.builder().budgetTokens(10000).build())
                        .addUserMessage("Are there an infinite number of prime numbers such that n mod 4 == 3?")
                        .build()
        );

        System.out.println(response);
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

To turn on extended thinking, add a `thinking` object, with the `type` parameter set to `enabled` and the `budget_tokens` to a specified token budget for extended thinking.

The `budget_tokens` parameter determines the maximum number of tokens Claude is allowed to use for its internal reasoning process. In Claude 4 models, this limit applies to full thinking tokens, and not to [the summarized output](#summarized-thinking). Larger budgets can improve response quality by enabling more thorough analysis for complex problems, although Claude may not use the entire budget allocated, especially at ranges above 32k.

`budget_tokens` must be set to a value less than `max_tokens`. However, when using [interleaved thinking with tools](#interleaved-thinking), you can exceed this limit as the token limit becomes your entire context window (200k tokens). 

### Summarized thinking

With extended thinking enabled, the Messages API for Claude 4 models returns a summary of Claude's full thinking process. Summarized thinking provides the full intelligence benefits of extended thinking, while preventing misuse.

Here are some important considerations for summarized thinking:

- You're charged for the full thinking tokens generated by the original request, not the summary tokens.
- The billed output token count will **not match** the count of tokens you see in the response.
- The first few lines of thinking output are more verbose, providing detailed reasoning that's particularly helpful for prompt engineering purposes. 
- As Anthropic seeks to improve the extended thinking feature, summarization behavior is subject to change.
- Summarization preserves the key ideas of Claude's thinking process with minimal added latency, enabling a streamable user experience and easy migration from Claude Sonnet 3.7 to Claude 4 models.
- Summarization is processed by a different model than the one you target in your requests. The thinking model does not see the summarized output.

<Note>
Claude Sonnet 3.7 continues to return full thinking output.

In rare cases where you need access to full thinking output for Claude 4 models, [contact our sales team](mailto:sales@anthropic.com).
</Note>

### Streaming thinking

You can stream extended thinking responses using [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/API/Server-sent%5Fevents/Using%5Fserver-sent%5Fevents).

When streaming is enabled for extended thinking, you receive thinking content via `thinking_delta` events.

For more documention on streaming via the Messages API, see [Streaming Messages](/docs/en/build-with-claude/streaming).

Here's how to handle streaming with thinking:

<Note>
When using streaming with thinking enabled, you might notice that text sometimes arrives in larger chunks alternating with smaller, token-by-token delivery. This is expected behavior, especially for thinking content.

The streaming system needs to process content in batches for optimal performance, which can result in this "chunky" delivery pattern, with possible delays between streaming events. We're continuously working to improve this experience, with future updates focused on making thinking content stream more smoothly.
</Note>

## Extended thinking with tool use

Extended thinking can be used alongside [tool use](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview), allowing Claude to reason through tool selection and results processing.

When using extended thinking with tool use, be aware of the following limitations:

1. **Tool choice limitation**: Tool use with thinking only supports `tool_choice: {"type": "auto"}` (the default) or `tool_choice: {"type": "none"}`. Using `tool_choice: {"type": "any"}` or `tool_choice: {"type": "tool", "name": "..."}` will result in an error because these options force tool use, which is incompatible with extended thinking.

2. **Preserving thinking blocks**: During tool use, you must pass `thinking` blocks back to the API for the last assistant message. Include the complete unmodified block back to the API to maintain reasoning continuity.

### Toggling thinking modes in conversations

You cannot toggle thinking in the middle of an assistant turn, including during tool use loops. The entire assistant turn should operate in a single thinking mode:

- **If thinking is enabled**, the final assistant turn should start with a thinking block.
- **If thinking is disabled**, the final assistant turn should not contain any thinking blocks

From the model's perspective, **tool use loops are part of the assistant turn**. An assistant turn doesn't complete until Claude finishes its full response, which may include multiple tool calls and results.

For example, this sequence is all part of a **single assistant turn**:
```
User: "What's the weather in Paris?"
Assistant: [thinking] + [tool_use: get_weather]
User: [tool_result: "20°C, sunny"]
Assistant: [text: "The weather in Paris is 20°C and sunny"]
```

Even though there are multiple API messages, the tool use loop is conceptually part of one continuous assistant response.

#### Graceful thinking degradation

When a mid-turn thinking conflict occurs (such as toggling thinking on or off during a tool use loop), the API automatically disables thinking for that request. To preserve model quality and remain on-distribution, the API may:

- Strip thinking blocks from the conversation when they would create an invalid turn structure
- Disable thinking for the current request when the conversation history is incompatible with thinking being enabled

This means that attempting to toggle thinking mid-turn won't cause an error, but thinking will be silently disabled for that request. To confirm whether thinking was active, check for the presence of `thinking` blocks in the response.

#### Practical guidance

**Best practice**: Plan your thinking strategy at the start of each turn rather than trying to toggle mid-turn.

**Example: Toggling thinking after completing a turn**
```
User: "What's the weather?"
Assistant: [tool_use] (thinking disabled)
User: [tool_result]
Assistant: [text: "It's sunny"]
User: "What about tomorrow?"
Assistant: [thinking] + [text: "..."] (thinking enabled - new turn)
```

By completing the assistant turn before toggling thinking, you ensure that thinking is actually enabled for the new request.

<Note>
Toggling thinking modes also invalidates prompt caching for message history. For more details, see the [Extended thinking with prompt caching](#extended-thinking-with-prompt-caching) section.
</Note>

<section title="Example: Passing thinking blocks with tool results">

Here's a practical example showing how to preserve thinking blocks when providing tool results:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
weather_tool = {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get current weather for a location",
    "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {"type": "string"}
        },
        "required": ["location"]
    }
}

# First request - Claude responds with thinking and tool request
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=16000,
    thinking={
        "type": "enabled",
        "budget_tokens": 10000
    },
    tools=[weather_tool],
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Paris?"}
    ]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
const weatherTool = {
  name: "get_weather",
  description: "Get current weather for a location",
  input_schema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      location: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["location"]
  }
};

// First request - Claude responds with thinking and tool request
const response = await client.messages.create({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  max_tokens: 16000,
  thinking: {
    type: "enabled",
    budget_tokens: 10000
  },
  tools: [weatherTool],
  messages: [
    { role: "user", content: "What's the weather in Paris?" }
  ]
});
```

        BetaTool weatherTool = BetaTool.builder()
                .name("get_weather")

        );

        System.out.println(response);
    }

</CodeGroup>

The API response will include thinking, text, and tool_use blocks:

        }
    ]
}
```

### Preserving thinking blocks

During tool use, you must pass `thinking` blocks back to the API, and you must include the complete unmodified block back to the API. This is critical for maintaining the model's reasoning flow and conversation integrity.

<Tip>
While you can omit `thinking` blocks from prior `assistant` role turns, we suggest always passing back all thinking blocks to the API for any multi-turn conversation. The API will:
- Automatically filter the provided thinking blocks
- Use the relevant thinking blocks necessary to preserve the model's reasoning
- Only bill for the input tokens for the blocks shown to Claude
</Tip>

<Note>
When toggling thinking modes during a conversation, remember that the entire assistant turn (including tool use loops) must operate in a single thinking mode. For more details, see [Toggling thinking modes in conversations](#toggling-thinking-modes-in-conversations).
</Note>

When Claude invokes tools, it is pausing its construction of a response to await external information. When tool results are returned, Claude will continue building that existing response. This necessitates preserving thinking blocks during tool use, for a couple of reasons:

1. **Reasoning continuity**: The thinking blocks capture Claude's step-by-step reasoning that led to tool requests. When you post tool results, including the original thinking ensures Claude can continue its reasoning from where it left off.

2. **Context maintenance**: While tool results appear as user messages in the API structure, they're part of a continuous reasoning flow. Preserving thinking blocks maintains this conceptual flow across multiple API calls. For more information on context management, see our [guide on context windows](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows).

**Important**: When providing `thinking` blocks, the entire sequence of consecutive `thinking` blocks must match the outputs generated by the model during the original request; you cannot rearrange or modify the sequence of these blocks.

### Interleaved thinking

Extended thinking with tool use in Claude 4 models supports interleaved thinking, which enables Claude to think between tool calls and make more sophisticated reasoning after receiving tool results.

With interleaved thinking, Claude can:
- Reason about the results of a tool call before deciding what to do next
- Chain multiple tool calls with reasoning steps in between
- Make more nuanced decisions based on intermediate results

To enable interleaved thinking, add [the beta header](/docs/en/api/beta-headers) `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` to your API request.

Here are some important considerations for interleaved thinking:
- With interleaved thinking, the `budget_tokens` can exceed the `max_tokens` parameter, as it represents the total budget across all thinking blocks within one assistant turn.
- Interleaved thinking is only supported for [tools used via the Messages API](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview).
- Interleaved thinking is supported for Claude 4 models only, with the beta header `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14`.
- Direct calls to the Claude API allow you to pass `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` in requests to any model, with no effect.
- On 3rd-party platforms (e.g., [Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-amazon-bedrock) and [Vertex AI](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-vertex-ai)), if you pass `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` to any model aside from Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Opus 4.1, Opus 4, or Sonnet 4, your request will fail.

<section title="Tool use without interleaved thinking">

Without interleaved thinking, Claude thinks once at the start of the assistant turn. Subsequent responses after tool results continue without new thinking blocks.

```
User: "What's the total revenue if we sold 150 units at $50 each,
       and how does this compare to our average monthly revenue?"

Turn 1: [thinking] "I need to calculate 150 * $50, then check the database..."
        [tool_use: calculator] { "expression": "150 * 50" }
  ↓ tool result: "7500"

Turn 2: [tool_use: database_query] { "query": "SELECT AVG(revenue)..." }
        ↑ no thinking block
  ↓ tool result: "5200"

Turn 3: [text] "The total revenue is $7,500, which is 44% above your
        average monthly revenue of $5,200."
        ↑ no thinking block
```

</section>

<section title="Tool use with interleaved thinking">

With interleaved thinking enabled, Claude can think after receiving each tool result, allowing it to reason about intermediate results before continuing.

```
User: "What's the total revenue if we sold 150 units at $50 each,
       and how does this compare to our average monthly revenue?"

Turn 1: [thinking] "I need to calculate 150 * $50 first..."
        [tool_use: calculator] { "expression": "150 * 50" }
  ↓ tool result: "7500"

Turn 2: [thinking] "Got $7,500. Now I should query the database to compare..."
        [tool_use: database_query] { "query": "SELECT AVG(revenue)..." }
        ↑ thinking after receiving calculator result
  ↓ tool result: "5200"

Turn 3: [thinking] "$7,500 vs $5,200 average - that's a 44% increase..."
        [text] "The total revenue is $7,500, which is 44% above your
        average monthly revenue of $5,200."
        ↑ thinking before final answer
```

</section>

## Extended thinking with prompt caching

[Prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) with thinking has several important considerations:

<Tip>
Extended thinking tasks often take longer than 5 minutes to complete. Consider using the [1-hour cache duration](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#1-hour-cache-duration) to maintain cache hits across longer thinking sessions and multi-step workflows.
</Tip>

**Thinking block context removal**
- Thinking blocks from previous turns are removed from context, which can affect cache breakpoints
- When continuing conversations with tool use, thinking blocks are cached and count as input tokens when read from cache
- This creates a tradeoff: while thinking blocks don't consume context window space visually, they still count toward your input token usage when cached
- If thinking becomes disabled and you pass thinking content in the current tool use turn, the thinking content will be stripped and thinking will remain disabled for that request

**Cache invalidation patterns**
- Changes to thinking parameters (enabled/disabled or budget allocation) invalidate message cache breakpoints
- [Interleaved thinking](#interleaved-thinking) amplifies cache invalidation, as thinking blocks can occur between multiple [tool calls](#extended-thinking-with-tool-use)
- System prompts and tools remain cached despite thinking parameter changes or block removal

<Note>
While thinking blocks are removed for caching and context calculations, they must be preserved when continuing conversations with [tool use](#extended-thinking-with-tool-use), especially with [interleaved thinking](#interleaved-thinking).
</Note>

### Understanding thinking block caching behavior

When using extended thinking with tool use, thinking blocks exhibit specific caching behavior that affects token counting:

**How it works:**

1. Caching only occurs when you make a subsequent request that includes tool results
2. When the subsequent request is made, the previous conversation history (including thinking blocks) can be cached
3. These cached thinking blocks count as input tokens in your usage metrics when read from the cache
4. When a non-tool-result user block is included, all previous thinking blocks are ignored and stripped from context

**Detailed example flow:**

**Request 1:**
```
User: "What's the weather in Paris?"
```
**Response 1:**
```
[thinking_block_1] + [tool_use block 1]
```

**Request 2:**
```
User: ["What's the weather in Paris?"], 
Assistant: [thinking_block_1] + [tool_use block 1], 
User: [tool_result_1, cache=True]
```
**Response 2:**
```
[thinking_block_2] + [text block 2]
```
Request 2 writes a cache of the request content (not the response). The cache includes the original user message, the first thinking block, tool use block, and the tool result.

**Request 3:**
```
User: ["What's the weather in Paris?"],
Assistant: [thinking_block_1] + [tool_use block 1],
User: [tool_result_1, cache=True],
Assistant: [thinking_block_2] + [text block 2],
User: [Text response, cache=True]
```
For Claude Opus 4.5 and later, all previous thinking blocks are kept by default. For older models, because a non-tool-result user block was included, all previous thinking blocks are ignored. This request will be processed the same as:
```
User: ["What's the weather in Paris?"],
Assistant: [tool_use block 1],
User: [tool_result_1, cache=True],
Assistant: [text block 2],
User: [Text response, cache=True]
```

**Key points:**
- This caching behavior happens automatically, even without explicit `cache_control` markers
- This behavior is consistent whether using regular thinking or interleaved thinking

        // Remove remaining HTML tags
        String noTags = withLineBreaks.replaceAll("<[^>]*>", "");

        // Decode HTML entities (simplified for common entities)
        return decodeHtmlEntities(noTags);
    }

    /**
     * Simple HTML entity decoder for common entities
     */
    private static String decodeHtmlEntities(String text) {
        return text
                .replaceAll("&nbsp;", " ")
                .replaceAll("&amp;", "&")
                .replaceAll("&lt;", "<")
                .replaceAll("&gt;", ">")
                .replaceAll("&quot;", "\"")
                .replaceAll("&#39;", "'")
                .replaceAll("&hellip;", "...")
                .replaceAll("&mdash;", "—");
    }

}
```
</CodeGroup>

Here is the output of the script (you may see slightly different numbers)

```
First request - establishing cache
First response usage: { cache_creation_input_tokens: 1370, cache_read_input_tokens: 0, input_tokens: 17, output_tokens: 700 }

Second request - same thinking parameters (cache hit expected)

Second response usage: { cache_creation_input_tokens: 0, cache_read_input_tokens: 1370, input_tokens: 303, output_tokens: 874 }

Third request - different thinking budget (cache miss expected)
Third response usage: { cache_creation_input_tokens: 1370, cache_read_input_tokens: 0, input_tokens: 747, output_tokens: 619 }
```

This example demonstrates that when caching is set up in the messages array, changing the thinking parameters (budget_tokens increased from 4000 to 8000) **invalidates the cache**. The third request shows no cache hit with `cache_creation_input_tokens=1370` and `cache_read_input_tokens=0`, proving that message-based caching is invalidated when thinking parameters change.

## Max tokens and context window size with extended thinking

In older Claude models (prior to Claude Sonnet 3.7), if the sum of prompt tokens and `max_tokens` exceeded the model's context window, the system would automatically adjust `max_tokens` to fit within the context limit. This meant you could set a large `max_tokens` value and the system would silently reduce it as needed.

With Claude 3.7 and 4 models, `max_tokens` (which includes your thinking budget when thinking is enabled) is enforced as a strict limit. The system will now return a validation error if prompt tokens + `max_tokens` exceeds the context window size.

<Note>
You can read through our [guide on context windows](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) for a more thorough deep dive.
</Note>

### The context window with extended thinking

When calculating context window usage with thinking enabled, there are some considerations to be aware of:

- Thinking blocks from previous turns are stripped and not counted towards your context window
- Current turn thinking counts towards your `max_tokens` limit for that turn

The diagram below demonstrates the specialized token management when extended thinking is enabled:

![Context window diagram with extended thinking](/docs/images/context-window-thinking.svg)

The effective context window is calculated as:

```
context window =
  (current input tokens - previous thinking tokens) +
  (thinking tokens + encrypted thinking tokens + text output tokens)
```

We recommend using the [token counting API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) to get accurate token counts for your specific use case, especially when working with multi-turn conversations that include thinking.

### The context window with extended thinking and tool use

When using extended thinking with tool use, thinking blocks must be explicitly preserved and returned with the tool results.

The effective context window calculation for extended thinking with tool use becomes: 

```
context window =
  (current input tokens + previous thinking tokens + tool use tokens) +
  (thinking tokens + encrypted thinking tokens + text output tokens)
```

The diagram below illustrates token management for extended thinking with tool use:

![Context window diagram with extended thinking and tool use](/docs/images/context-window-thinking-tools.svg)

### Managing tokens with extended thinking

Given the context window and `max_tokens` behavior with extended thinking Claude 3.7 and 4 models, you may need to:

- More actively monitor and manage your token usage
- Adjust `max_tokens` values as your prompt length changes
- Potentially use the [token counting endpoints](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) more frequently
- Be aware that previous thinking blocks don't accumulate in your context window

This change has been made to provide more predictable and transparent behavior, especially as maximum token limits have increased significantly.

## Thinking encryption

Full thinking content is encrypted and returned in the `signature` field. This field is used to verify that thinking blocks were generated by Claude when passed back to the API. 

<Note>
It is only strictly necessary to send back thinking blocks when using [tools with extended thinking](#extended-thinking-with-tool-use). Otherwise you can omit thinking blocks from previous turns, or let the API strip them for you if you pass them back. 

If sending back thinking blocks, we recommend passing everything back as you received it for consistency and to avoid potential issues.
</Note>

Here are some important considerations on thinking encryption:
- When [streaming responses](#streaming-thinking), the signature is added via a `signature_delta` inside a `content_block_delta` event just before the `content_block_stop` event.
- `signature` values are significantly longer in Claude 4 models than in previous models.
- The `signature` field is an opaque field and should not be interpreted or parsed - it exists solely for verification purposes.
- `signature` values are compatible across platforms (Claude APIs, [Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-amazon-bedrock), and [Vertex AI](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-vertex-ai)). Values generated on one platform will be compatible with another.

### Thinking redaction

Occasionally Claude's internal reasoning will be flagged by our safety systems. When this occurs, we encrypt some or all of the `thinking` block and return it to you as a `redacted_thinking` block. `redacted_thinking` blocks are decrypted when passed back to the API, allowing Claude to continue its response without losing context.

When building customer-facing applications that use extended thinking:

- Be aware that redacted thinking blocks contain encrypted content that isn't human-readable
- Consider providing a simple explanation like: "Some of Claude's internal reasoning has been automatically encrypted for safety reasons. This doesn't affect the quality of responses."
- If showing thinking blocks to users, you can filter out redacted blocks while preserving normal thinking blocks
- Be transparent that using extended thinking features may occasionally result in some reasoning being encrypted
- Implement appropriate error handling to gracefully manage redacted thinking without breaking your UI

Here's an example showing both normal and redacted thinking blocks:

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "thinking",
      "thinking": "Let me analyze this step by step...",
      "signature": "WaUjzkypQ2mUEVM36O2TxuC06KN8xyfbJwyem2dw3URve/op91XWHOEBLLqIOMfFG/UvLEczmEsUjavL...."
    },
    {
      "type": "redacted_thinking",
      "data": "EmwKAhgBEgy3va3pzix/LafPsn4aDFIT2Xlxh0L5L8rLVyIwxtE3rAFBa8cr3qpPkNRj2YfWXGmKDxH4mPnZ5sQ7vB9URj2pLmN3kF8/dW5hR7xJ0aP1oLs9yTcMnKVf2wRpEGjH9XZaBt4UvDcPrQ..."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Based on my analysis..."
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
Seeing redacted thinking blocks in your output is expected behavior. The model can still use this redacted reasoning to inform its responses while maintaining safety guardrails.

If you need to test redacted thinking handling in your application, you can use this special test string as your prompt: `ANTHROPIC_MAGIC_STRING_TRIGGER_REDACTED_THINKING_46C9A13E193C177646C7398A98432ECCCE4C1253D5E2D82641AC0E52CC2876CB`
</Note>

When passing `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` blocks back to the API in a multi-turn conversation, you must include the complete unmodified block back to the API for the last assistant turn. This is critical for maintaining the model's reasoning flow. We suggest always passing back all thinking blocks to the API. For more details, see the [Preserving thinking blocks](#preserving-thinking-blocks) section above.

<section title="Example: Working with redacted thinking blocks">

This example demonstrates how to handle `redacted_thinking` blocks that may appear in responses when Claude's internal reasoning contains content flagged by safety systems:

## Differences in thinking across model versions

The Messages API handles thinking differently across Claude Sonnet 3.7 and Claude 4 models, primarily in redaction and summarization behavior.

See the table below for a condensed comparison:

| Feature | Claude Sonnet 3.7 | Claude 4 Models (pre-Opus 4.5) | Claude Opus 4.5 and later |
|---------|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Thinking Output** | Returns full thinking output | Returns summarized thinking | Returns summarized thinking |
| **Interleaved Thinking** | Not supported | Supported with `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` beta header | Supported with `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` beta header |
| **Thinking Block Preservation** | Not preserved across turns | Not preserved across turns | **Preserved by default** (enables cache optimization, token savings) |

### Thinking block preservation in Claude Opus 4.5

Claude Opus 4.5 introduces a new default behavior: **thinking blocks from previous assistant turns are preserved in model context by default**. This differs from earlier models, which remove thinking blocks from prior turns.

**Benefits of thinking block preservation:**

- **Cache optimization**: When using tool use, preserved thinking blocks enable cache hits as they are passed back with tool results and cached incrementally across the assistant turn, resulting in token savings in multi-step workflows
- **No intelligence impact**: Preserving thinking blocks has no negative effect on model performance

**Important considerations:**

- **Context usage**: Long conversations will consume more context space since thinking blocks are retained in context
- **Automatic behavior**: This is the default behavior for Claude Opus 4.5—no code changes or beta headers required
- **Backward compatibility**: To leverage this feature, continue passing complete, unmodified thinking blocks back to the API as you would for tool use

<Note>
For earlier models (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.1, etc.), thinking blocks from previous turns continue to be removed from context. The existing behavior described in the [Extended thinking with prompt caching](#extended-thinking-with-prompt-caching) section applies to those models.
</Note>

## Pricing

For complete pricing information including base rates, cache writes, cache hits, and output tokens, see the [pricing page](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing).

The thinking process incurs charges for:
- Tokens used during thinking (output tokens)
- Thinking blocks from the last assistant turn included in subsequent requests (input tokens)
- Standard text output tokens

<Note>
When extended thinking is enabled, a specialized system prompt is automatically included to support this feature.
</Note>

When using summarized thinking:
- **Input tokens**: Tokens in your original request (excludes thinking tokens from previous turns)
- **Output tokens (billed)**: The original thinking tokens that Claude generated internally
- **Output tokens (visible)**: The summarized thinking tokens you see in the response
- **No charge**: Tokens used to generate the summary

<Warning>
The billed output token count will **not** match the visible token count in the response. You are billed for the full thinking process, not the summary you see.
</Warning>

## Best practices and considerations for extended thinking

### Working with thinking budgets

- **Budget optimization:** The minimum budget is 1,024 tokens. We suggest starting at the minimum and increasing the thinking budget incrementally to find the optimal range for your use case. Higher token counts enable more comprehensive reasoning but with diminishing returns depending on the task. Increasing the budget can improve response quality at the tradeoff of increased latency. For critical tasks, test different settings to find the optimal balance. Note that the thinking budget is a target rather than a strict limit—actual token usage may vary based on the task.
- **Starting points:** Start with larger thinking budgets (16k+ tokens) for complex tasks and adjust based on your needs.
- **Large budgets:** For thinking budgets above 32k, we recommend using [batch processing](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing) to avoid networking issues. Requests pushing the model to think above 32k tokens causes long running requests that might run up against system timeouts and open connection limits.
- **Token usage tracking:** Monitor thinking token usage to optimize costs and performance.

### Performance considerations

- **Response times:** Be prepared for potentially longer response times due to the additional processing required for the reasoning process. Factor in that generating thinking blocks may increase overall response time.
- **Streaming requirements:** Streaming is required when `max_tokens` is greater than 21,333. When streaming, be prepared to handle both thinking and text content blocks as they arrive.

### Feature compatibility

- Thinking isn't compatible with `temperature` or `top_k` modifications as well as [forced tool use](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/implement-tool-use#forcing-tool-use).
- When thinking is enabled, you can set `top_p` to values between 1 and 0.95.
- You cannot pre-fill responses when thinking is enabled.
- Changes to the thinking budget invalidate cached prompt prefixes that include messages. However, cached system prompts and tool definitions will continue to work when thinking parameters change.

### Usage guidelines

- **Task selection:** Use extended thinking for particularly complex tasks that benefit from step-by-step reasoning like math, coding, and analysis.
- **Context handling:** You do not need to remove previous thinking blocks yourself. The Claude API automatically ignores thinking blocks from previous turns and they are not included when calculating context usage.
- **Prompt engineering:** Review our [extended thinking prompting tips](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips) if you want to maximize Claude's thinking capabilities.

# SECTION 7: Vision

# Vision

Claude's vision capabilities allow it to understand and analyze images, opening up exciting possibilities for multimodal interaction.

---

This guide describes how to work with images in Claude, including best practices, code examples, and limitations to keep in mind.

---

## How to use vision

Use Claude’s vision capabilities via:

- [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/). Upload an image like you would a file, or drag and drop an image directly into the chat window.
- The [Console Workbench](/workbench/). A button to add images appears at the top right of every User message block.
- **API request**. See the examples in this guide.

---

## Before you upload

### Basics and Limits

You can include multiple images in a single request (up to 20 for [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) and 100 for API requests). Claude will analyze all provided images when formulating its response. This can be helpful for comparing or contrasting images.

If you submit an image larger than 8000x8000 px, it will be rejected. If you submit more than 20 images in one API request, this limit is 2000x2000 px.

<Note>
While the API supports 100 images per request, there is a [32MB request size limit](/docs/en/api/overview#request-size-limits) for standard endpoints.
</Note>

### Evaluate image size

For optimal performance, we recommend resizing images before uploading if they are too large. If your image’s long edge is more than 1568 pixels, or your image is more than ~1,600 tokens, it will first be scaled down, preserving aspect ratio, until it’s within the size limits.

If your input image is too large and needs to be resized, it will increase latency of [time-to-first-token](/docs/en/about-claude/glossary), without giving you any additional model performance. Very small images under 200 pixels on any given edge may degrade performance.

<Tip>
  To improve [time-to-first-token](/docs/en/about-claude/glossary), we recommend
  resizing images to no more than 1.15 megapixels (and within 1568 pixels in
  both dimensions).
</Tip>

Here is a table of maximum image sizes accepted by our API that will not be resized for common aspect ratios. With Claude Sonnet 4.5, these images use approximately 1,600 tokens and around $4.80/1K images.

| Aspect ratio | Image size   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 1&#58;1      | 1092x1092 px |
| 3&#58;4      | 951x1268 px  |
| 2&#58;3      | 896x1344 px  |
| 9&#58;16     | 819x1456 px  |
| 1&#58;2      | 784x1568 px  |

### Calculate image costs

Each image you include in a request to Claude counts towards your token usage. To calculate the approximate cost, multiply the approximate number of image tokens by the [per-token price of the model](https://claude.com/pricing) you’re using.

If your image does not need to be resized, you can estimate the number of tokens used through this algorithm: `tokens = (width px * height px)/750`

Here are examples of approximate tokenization and costs for different image sizes within our API's size constraints based on Claude Sonnet 4.5 per-token price of $3 per million input tokens:

| Image size                    | \# of Tokens | Cost / image | Cost / 1K images |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 200x200 px(0.04 megapixels)   | \~54         | \~$0.00016   | \~$0.16          |
| 1000x1000 px(1 megapixel)     | \~1334       | \~$0.004     | \~$4.00          |
| 1092x1092 px(1.19 megapixels) | \~1590       | \~$0.0048    | \~$4.80          |

### Ensuring image quality

When providing images to Claude, keep the following in mind for best results:

- **Image format**: Use a supported image format: JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP.
- **Image clarity**: Ensure images are clear and not too blurry or pixelated.
- **Text**: If the image contains important text, make sure it’s legible and not too small. Avoid cropping out key visual context just to enlarge the text.

---

## Prompt examples

Many of the [prompting techniques](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) that work well for text-based interactions with Claude can also be applied to image-based prompts.

These examples demonstrate best practice prompt structures involving images.

<Tip>
  Just as with document-query placement, Claude works best when images come
  before text. Images placed after text or interpolated with text will still
  perform well, but if your use case allows it, we recommend an image-then-text
  structure.
</Tip>

### About the prompt examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use Claude's vision capabilities using various programming languages and approaches. You can provide images to Claude in three ways:

1. As a base64-encoded image in `image` content blocks
2. As a URL reference to an image hosted online  
3. Using the Files API (upload once, use multiple times)

The base64 example prompts use these variables:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Shell
    # For URL-based images, you can use the URL directly in your JSON request
    
    # For base64-encoded images, you need to first encode the image
    # Example of how to encode an image to base64 in bash:
    BASE64_IMAGE_DATA=$(curl -s "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Camponotus_flavomarginatus_ant.jpg" | base64)
    
    # The encoded data can now be used in your API calls
```

```python Python
import base64
import httpx

# For base64-encoded images
image1_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Camponotus_flavomarginatus_ant.jpg"
image1_media_type = "image/jpeg"
image1_data = base64.standard_b64encode(httpx.get(image1_url).content).decode("utf-8")

image2_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Iridescent.green.sweat.bee1.jpg"
image2_media_type = "image/jpeg"
image2_data = base64.standard_b64encode(httpx.get(image2_url).content).decode("utf-8")

# For URL-based images, you can use the URLs directly in your requests
```

```typescript TypeScript
import axios from 'axios';

// For base64-encoded images
async function getBase64Image(url: string): Promise<string> {
  const response = await axios.get(url, { responseType: 'arraybuffer' });
  return Buffer.from(response.data, 'binary').toString('base64');
}

// Usage
async function prepareImages() {
  const imageData = await getBase64Image('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Camponotus_flavomarginatus_ant.jpg');
  // Now you can use imageData in your API calls
}

// For URL-based images, you can use the URLs directly in your requests
```

```java Java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Base64;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.net.URL;

public class ImageHandlingExample {

### Files API image example

For images you'll use repeatedly or when you want to avoid encoding overhead, use the [Files API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/files):

<CodeGroup>
```bash Shell
# First, upload your image to the Files API
curl -X POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14" \
  -F "file=@image.jpg"

# Then use the returned file_id in your message
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \

<section title="Example: One image">

It’s best to place images earlier in the prompt than questions about them or instructions for tasks that use them.

Ask Claude to describe one image.

| Role | Content                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| User | \[Image\] Describe this image. |

<section title="Example: Four images across two conversation turns">

Claude’s vision capabilities shine in multimodal conversations that mix images and text. You can have extended back-and-forth exchanges with Claude, adding new images or follow-up questions at any point. This enables powerful workflows for iterative image analysis, comparison, or combining visuals with other knowledge.

Ask Claude to contrast two images, then ask a follow-up question comparing the first images to two new images.
| Role | Content |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| User | Image 1: \[Image 1\] Image 2: \[Image 2\] How are these images different? |
| Assistant | \[Claude's response\] |
| User | Image 1: \[Image 3\] Image 2: \[Image 4\] Are these images similar to the first two? |
| Assistant | \[Claude's response\] |

When using the API, simply insert new images into the array of Messages in the `user` role as part of any standard [multiturn conversation](/docs/en/api/messages) structure.

## Limitations

While Claude's image understanding capabilities are cutting-edge, there are some limitations to be aware of:

- **People identification**: Claude [cannot be used](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup) to identify (i.e., name) people in images and will refuse to do so.
- **Accuracy**: Claude may hallucinate or make mistakes when interpreting low-quality, rotated, or very small images under 200 pixels.
- **Spatial reasoning**: Claude's spatial reasoning abilities are limited. It may struggle with tasks requiring precise localization or layouts, like reading an analog clock face or describing exact positions of chess pieces.
- **Counting**: Claude can give approximate counts of objects in an image but may not always be precisely accurate, especially with large numbers of small objects.
- **AI generated images**: Claude does not know if an image is AI-generated and may be incorrect if asked. Do not rely on it to detect fake or synthetic images.
- **Inappropriate content**: Claude will not process inappropriate or explicit images that violate our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup).
- **Healthcare applications**: While Claude can analyze general medical images, it is not designed to interpret complex diagnostic scans such as CTs or MRIs. Claude's outputs should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.

Always carefully review and verify Claude's image interpretations, especially for high-stakes use cases. Do not use Claude for tasks requiring perfect precision or sensitive image analysis without human oversight.

    Requests exceeding these limits will be rejected and return an error.

  
</section>

{" "}

<section title="Does Claude read image metadata?">

  No, Claude does not parse or receive any metadata from images passed to it.

</section>

{" "}

<section title="Can I delete images I've uploaded?">

  No. Image uploads are ephemeral and not stored beyond the duration of the API
  request. Uploaded images are automatically deleted after they have been
  processed.

</section>

{" "}

<section title="Where can I find details on data privacy for image uploads?">

  Please refer to our privacy policy page for information on how we handle
  uploaded images and other data. We do not use uploaded images to train our
  models.

</section>

  <section title="What if Claude's image interpretation seems wrong?">

    If Claude's image interpretation seems incorrect:
    1. Ensure the image is clear, high-quality, and correctly oriented.
    2. Try prompt engineering techniques to improve results.
    3. If the issue persists, flag the output in claude.ai (thumbs up/down) or contact our support team.

    Your feedback helps us improve!

  
</section>

  <section title="Can Claude generate or edit images?">

    No, Claude is an image understanding model only. It can interpret and analyze images, but it cannot generate, produce, edit, manipulate, or create images.

### Tools

# SECTION 8: PDF Support

# PDF support

Process PDFs with Claude. Extract text, analyze charts, and understand visual content from your documents.

---

You can now ask Claude about any text, pictures, charts, and tables in PDFs you provide. Some sample use cases:
- Analyzing financial reports and understanding charts/tables
- Extracting key information from legal documents
- Translation assistance for documents
- Converting document information into structured formats

## Before you begin

### Check PDF requirements
Claude works with any standard PDF. However, you should ensure your request size meets these requirements when using PDF support:

| Requirement | Limit |
|------------|--------|
| Maximum request size | 32MB |
| Maximum pages per request | 100 |
| Format | Standard PDF (no passwords/encryption) |

Please note that both limits are on the entire request payload, including any other content sent alongside PDFs.

Since PDF support relies on Claude's vision capabilities, it is subject to the same [limitations and considerations](/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision#limitations) as other vision tasks.

### Supported platforms and models

PDF support is currently supported via direct API access and Google Vertex AI. All [active models](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview) support PDF processing.

PDF support is now available on Amazon Bedrock with the following considerations:

### Amazon Bedrock PDF Support

When using PDF support through Amazon Bedrock's Converse API, there are two distinct document processing modes:

<Note>
**Important**: To access Claude's full visual PDF understanding capabilities in the Converse API, you must enable citations. Without citations enabled, the API falls back to basic text extraction only. Learn more about [working with citations](/docs/en/build-with-claude/citations).
</Note>

#### Document Processing Modes

1. **Converse Document Chat** (Original mode - Text extraction only)
   - Provides basic text extraction from PDFs
   - Cannot analyze images, charts, or visual layouts within PDFs
   - Uses approximately 1,000 tokens for a 3-page PDF
   - Automatically used when citations are not enabled

2. **Claude PDF Chat** (New mode - Full visual understanding)
   - Provides complete visual analysis of PDFs
   - Can understand and analyze charts, graphs, images, and visual layouts
   - Processes each page as both text and image for comprehensive understanding
   - Uses approximately 7,000 tokens for a 3-page PDF
   - **Requires citations to be enabled** in the Converse API

#### Key Limitations

- **Converse API**: Visual PDF analysis requires citations to be enabled. There is currently no option to use visual analysis without citations (unlike the InvokeModel API).
- **InvokeModel API**: Provides full control over PDF processing without forced citations.

#### Common Issues

If customers report that Claude isn't seeing images or charts in their PDFs when using the Converse API, they likely need to enable the citations flag. Without it, Converse falls back to basic text extraction only.

<Note>
This is a known constraint with the Converse API that we're working to address. For applications that require visual PDF analysis without citations, consider using the InvokeModel API instead.
</Note>

<Note>
For non-PDF files like .csv, .xlsx, .docx, .md, or .txt files, see [Working with other file formats](/docs/en/build-with-claude/files#working-with-other-file-formats).
</Note>

## Process PDFs with Claude

### Send your first PDF request
Let's start with a simple example using the Messages API. You can provide PDFs to Claude in three ways:

1. As a URL reference to a PDF hosted online
2. As a base64-encoded PDF in `document` content blocks  
3. By a `file_id` from the [Files API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/files)

#### Option 1: URL-based PDF document

The simplest approach is to reference a PDF directly from a URL:

<CodeGroup>
   ```bash Shell
    curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
      -H "content-type: application/json" \
      -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
      -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \

#### Option 3: Files API

For PDFs you'll use repeatedly, or when you want to avoid encoding overhead, use the [Files API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/files): 

<CodeGroup>
```bash Shell

curl -X POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14" \
  -F "file=@document.pdf"

# Then use the returned file_id in your message
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \

### How PDF support works
When you send a PDF to Claude, the following steps occur:
<Steps>
  <Step title="The system extracts the contents of the document.">
    - The system converts each page of the document into an image.
    - The text from each page is extracted and provided alongside each page's image.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claude analyzes both the text and images to better understand the document.">
    - Documents are provided as a combination of text and images for analysis.
    - This allows users to ask for insights on visual elements of a PDF, such as charts, diagrams, and other non-textual content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claude responds, referencing the PDF's contents if relevant.">
    Claude can reference both textual and visual content when it responds. You can further improve performance by integrating PDF support with:
    - **Prompt caching**: To improve performance for repeated analysis.
    - **Batch processing**: For high-volume document processing.
    - **Tool use**: To extract specific information from documents for use as tool inputs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Estimate your costs
The token count of a PDF file depends on the total text extracted from the document as well as the number of pages:
- Text token costs: Each page typically uses 1,500-3,000 tokens per page depending on content density. Standard API pricing applies with no additional PDF fees.
- Image token costs: Since each page is converted into an image, the same [image-based cost calculations](/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision#evaluate-image-size) are applied.

You can use [token counting](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) to estimate costs for your specific PDFs.

## Optimize PDF processing

### Improve performance
Follow these best practices for optimal results:
- Place PDFs before text in your requests
- Use standard fonts
- Ensure text is clear and legible
- Rotate pages to proper upright orientation
- Use logical page numbers (from PDF viewer) in prompts
- Split large PDFs into chunks when needed
- Enable prompt caching for repeated analysis

### Scale your implementation
For high-volume processing, consider these approaches:

#### Use prompt caching
Cache PDFs to improve performance on repeated queries:

# SECTION 9: Structured Outputs

# Structured outputs

Get validated JSON results from agent workflows

---

Structured outputs constrain Claude's responses to follow a specific schema, ensuring valid, parseable output for downstream processing. Two complementary features are available:

- **JSON outputs** (`output_config.format`): Get Claude's response in a specific JSON format
- **Strict tool use** (`strict: true`): Guarantee schema validation on tool names and inputs

These features can be used independently or together in the same request.

<Note>
Structured outputs are generally available on the Claude API for Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.5, and Claude Haiku 4.5. Structured outputs remain in public beta on Amazon Bedrock and Microsoft Foundry.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Migrating from beta?** The `output_format` parameter has moved to `output_config.format`, and beta headers are no longer required. The old beta header (`structured-outputs-2025-11-13`) and `output_format` parameter will continue working for a transition period. See code examples below for the updated API shape.
</Tip>

## Why use structured outputs

Without structured outputs, Claude can generate malformed JSON responses or invalid tool inputs that break your applications. Even with careful prompting, you may encounter:
- Parsing errors from invalid JSON syntax
- Missing required fields
- Inconsistent data types
- Schema violations requiring error handling and retries

Structured outputs guarantee schema-compliant responses through constrained decoding:
- **Always valid**: No more `JSON.parse()` errors
- **Type safe**: Guaranteed field types and required fields
- **Reliable**: No retries needed for schema violations

## JSON outputs

JSON outputs control Claude's response format, ensuring Claude returns valid JSON matching your schema. Use JSON outputs when you need to:

- Control Claude's response format
- Extract data from images or text
- Generate structured reports
- Format API responses

  }'
```

```python Python

        additionalProperties: false
      }
    }
  }
});
console.log(response.content[0].text);
```

</CodeGroup>

**Response format:** Valid JSON matching your schema in `response.content[0].text`

```json
{
  "name": "John Smith",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "plan_interest": "Enterprise",
  "demo_requested": true
}
```

### How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your JSON schema">
    Create a JSON schema that describes the structure you want Claude to follow. The schema uses standard JSON Schema format with some limitations (see [JSON Schema limitations](#json-schema-limitations)).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the output_config.format parameter">
    Include the `output_config.format` parameter in your API request with `type: "json_schema"` and your schema definition.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Parse the response">
    Claude's response will be valid JSON matching your schema, returned in `response.content[0].text`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Working with JSON outputs in SDKs

The Python and TypeScript SDKs provide helpers that make it easier to work with JSON outputs, including schema transformation, automatic validation, and integration with popular schema libraries.

#### Using Pydantic and Zod

For Python and TypeScript developers, you can use familiar schema definition tools like Pydantic and Zod instead of writing raw JSON schemas.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from anthropic import Anthropic, transform_schema

class ContactInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: str
    plan_interest: str
    demo_requested: bool

client = Anthropic()

# With .create() - requires transform_schema()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract the key information from this email: John Smith (john@example.com) is interested in our Enterprise plan and wants to schedule a demo for next Tuesday at 2pm."
        }
    ],
    output_config={
        "format": {
            "type": "json_schema",
            "schema": transform_schema(ContactInfo),
        }
    }
)

print(response.content[0].text)

# With .parse() - can pass Pydantic model directly
response = client.messages.parse(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract the key information from this email: John Smith (john@example.com) is interested in our Enterprise plan and wants to schedule a demo for next Tuesday at 2pm."
        }
    ],
    output_format=ContactInfo,
)

print(response.parsed_output)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { zodOutputFormat } from '@anthropic-ai/sdk/helpers/zod';

const ContactInfoSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  email: z.string(),
  plan_interest: z.string(),
  demo_requested: z.boolean(),
});

const client = new Anthropic();

const response = await client.messages.create({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  max_tokens: 1024,
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Extract the key information from this email: John Smith (john@example.com) is interested in our Enterprise plan and wants to schedule a demo for next Tuesday at 2pm."
    }
  ],
  output_config: { format: zodOutputFormat(ContactInfoSchema) },
});

// Automatically parsed and validated
console.log(response.content[0].text);
```

</CodeGroup>

#### SDK-specific methods

**Python: `client.messages.parse()` (Recommended)**

The `parse()` method automatically transforms your Pydantic model, validates the response, and returns a `parsed_output` attribute.

<section title="Example usage">

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
import anthropic

class ContactInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: str
    plan_interest: str

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.parse(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
    output_format=ContactInfo,
)

# Access the parsed output directly
contact = response.parsed_output
print(contact.name, contact.email)
```

</section>

**Python: `transform_schema()` helper**

For when you need to manually transform schemas before sending, or when you want to modify a Pydantic-generated schema. Unlike `client.messages.parse()`, which transforms provided schemas automatically, this gives you the transformed schema so you can further customize it.

<section title="Example usage">

```python
from anthropic import transform_schema
from pydantic import TypeAdapter

# First convert Pydantic model to JSON schema, then transform
schema = TypeAdapter(ContactInfo).json_schema()
schema = transform_schema(schema)
# Modify schema if needed
schema["properties"]["custom_field"] = {"type": "string"}

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
    output_config={
        "format": {"type": "json_schema", "schema": schema},
    },
)
```

</section>

#### How SDK transformation works

Both Python and TypeScript SDKs automatically transform schemas with unsupported features:

1. **Remove unsupported constraints** (e.g., `minimum`, `maximum`, `minLength`, `maxLength`)
2. **Update descriptions** with constraint info (e.g., "Must be at least 100"), when the constraint is not directly supported with structured outputs
3. **Add `additionalProperties: false`** to all objects
4. **Filter string formats** to supported list only
5. **Validate responses** against your original schema (with all constraints)

This means Claude receives a simplified schema, but your code still enforces all constraints through validation.

**Example:** A Pydantic field with `minimum: 100` becomes a plain integer in the sent schema, but the description is updated to "Must be at least 100", and the SDK validates the response against the original constraint.

### Common use cases

<section title="Data extraction">

Extract structured data from unstructured text:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class Invoice(BaseModel):
    invoice_number: str
    date: str
    total_amount: float
    line_items: List[dict]
    customer_name: str

response = client.messages.parse(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    output_format=Invoice,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Extract invoice data from: {invoice_text}"}]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { zodOutputFormat } from '@anthropic-ai/sdk/helpers/zod';

const InvoiceSchema = z.object({
  invoice_number: z.string(),
  date: z.string(),
  total_amount: z.number(),
  line_items: z.array(z.record(z.string(), z.any())),
  customer_name: z.string(),
});

const response = await client.messages.create({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  output_config: { format: zodOutputFormat(InvoiceSchema) },
  messages: [{"role": "user", "content": `Extract invoice data from: ${invoiceText}`}]
});
```

</section>

<section title="Classification">

Classify content with structured categories:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class Classification(BaseModel):
    category: str
    confidence: float
    tags: List[str]
    sentiment: str

response = client.messages.parse(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    output_format=Classification,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Classify this feedback: {feedback_text}"}]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { zodOutputFormat } from '@anthropic-ai/sdk/helpers/zod';

const ClassificationSchema = z.object({
  category: z.string(),
  confidence: z.number(),
  tags: z.array(z.string()),
  sentiment: z.string(),
});

const response = await client.messages.create({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  output_config: { format: zodOutputFormat(ClassificationSchema) },
  messages: [{"role": "user", "content": `Classify this feedback: ${feedbackText}`}]
});
```

</CodeGroup>

</section>

<section title="API response formatting">

Generate API-ready responses:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional

class APIResponse(BaseModel):
    status: str
    data: dict
    errors: Optional[List[dict]]
    metadata: dict

response = client.messages.parse(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    output_format=APIResponse,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Process this request: ..."}]

  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  output_config: { format: zodOutputFormat(APIResponseSchema) },
  messages: [{"role": "user", "content": "Process this request: ..."}]
});
```

## Strict tool use

Strict tool use validates tool parameters, ensuring Claude calls your functions with correctly-typed arguments. Use strict tool use when you need to:

- Validate tool parameters
- Build agentic workflows
- Ensure type-safe function calls
- Handle complex tools with nested properties

### Why strict tool use matters for agents

Building reliable agentic systems requires guaranteed schema conformance. Without strict mode, Claude might return incompatible types (`"2"` instead of `2`) or missing required fields, breaking your functions and causing runtime errors.

Strict tool use guarantees type-safe parameters:
- Functions receive correctly-typed arguments every time
- No need to validate and retry tool calls
- Production-ready agents that work consistently at scale

For example, suppose a booking system needs `passengers: int`. Without strict mode, Claude might provide `passengers: "two"` or `passengers: "2"`. With `strict: true`, the response will always contain `passengers: 2`.

```typescript TypeScript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const client = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
});

const response = await client.messages.create({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  max_tokens: 1024,
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",

console.log(response.content);

</CodeGroup>

**Response format:** Tool use blocks with validated inputs in `response.content[x].input`

```json
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "name": "get_weather",
  "input": {
    "location": "San Francisco, CA"
  }
}
```

**Guarantees:**
- Tool `input` strictly follows the `input_schema`
- Tool `name` is always valid (from provided tools or server tools)

### How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your tool schema">
    Create a JSON schema for your tool's `input_schema`. The schema uses standard JSON Schema format with some limitations (see [JSON Schema limitations](#json-schema-limitations)).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add strict: true">
    Set `"strict": true` as a top-level property in your tool definition, alongside `name`, `description`, and `input_schema`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle tool calls">
    When Claude uses the tool, the `input` field in the tool_use block will strictly follow your `input_schema`, and the `name` will always be valid.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common use cases

## Using both features together

JSON outputs and strict tool use solve different problems and can be used together:

- **JSON outputs** control Claude's response format (what Claude says)
- **Strict tool use** validates tool parameters (how Claude calls your functions)

When combined, Claude can call tools with guaranteed-valid parameters AND return structured JSON responses. This is useful for agentic workflows where you need both reliable tool calls and structured final outputs.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Help me plan a trip to Paris for next month"}],
    # JSON outputs: structured response format
    output_config={
        "format": {
            "type": "json_schema",
            "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "summary": {"type": "string"},
                    "next_steps": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
                },
                "required": ["summary", "next_steps"],
                "additionalProperties": False
            }
        }
    },
    # Strict tool use: guaranteed tool parameters
    tools=[{
        "name": "search_flights",
        "strict": True,
        "input_schema": {
            "type": "object",

## Important considerations

### Grammar compilation and caching

Structured outputs use constrained sampling with compiled grammar artifacts. This introduces some performance characteristics to be aware of:

- **First request latency**: The first time you use a specific schema, there will be additional latency while the grammar is compiled
- **Automatic caching**: Compiled grammars are cached for 24 hours from last use, making subsequent requests much faster
- **Cache invalidation**: The cache is invalidated if you change:
  - The JSON schema structure
  - The set of tools in your request (when using both structured outputs and tool use)
  - Changing only `name` or `description` fields does not invalidate the cache

### Prompt modification and token costs

When using structured outputs, Claude automatically receives an additional system prompt explaining the expected output format. This means:

- Your input token count will be slightly higher
- The injected prompt costs you tokens like any other system prompt
- Changing the `output_config.format` parameter will invalidate any [prompt cache](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) for that conversation thread

### JSON Schema limitations

Structured outputs support standard JSON Schema with some limitations. Both JSON outputs and strict tool use share these limitations.

<section title="Supported features">

- All basic types: object, array, string, integer, number, boolean, null
- `enum` (strings, numbers, bools, or nulls only - no complex types)
- `const`
- `anyOf` and `allOf` (with limitations - `allOf` with `$ref` not supported)
- `$ref`, `$def`, and `definitions` (external `$ref` not supported)
- `default` property for all supported types
- `required` and `additionalProperties` (must be set to `false` for objects)
- String formats: `date-time`, `time`, `date`, `duration`, `email`, `hostname`, `uri`, `ipv4`, `ipv6`, `uuid`
- Array `minItems` (only values 0 and 1 supported)

</section>

<section title="Not supported">

- Recursive schemas
- Complex types within enums
- External `$ref` (e.g., `'$ref': 'http://...'`)
- Numerical constraints (`minimum`, `maximum`, `multipleOf`, etc.)
- String constraints (`minLength`, `maxLength`)
- Array constraints beyond `minItems` of 0 or 1
- `additionalProperties` set to anything other than `false`

If you use an unsupported feature, you'll receive a 400 error with details.

</section>

<section title="Pattern support (regex)">

**Supported regex features:**
- Full matching (`^...$`) and partial matching
- Quantifiers: `*`, `+`, `?`, simple `{n,m}` cases
- Character classes: `[]`, `.`, `\d`, `\w`, `\s`
- Groups: `(...)`

**NOT supported:**
- Backreferences to groups (e.g., `\1`, `\2`)
- Lookahead/lookbehind assertions (e.g., `(?=...)`, `(?!...)`)
- Word boundaries: `\b`, `\B`
- Complex `{n,m}` quantifiers with large ranges

Simple regex patterns work well. Complex patterns may result in 400 errors.

</section>

<Tip>
The Python and TypeScript SDKs can automatically transform schemas with unsupported features by removing them and adding constraints to field descriptions. See [SDK-specific methods](#sdk-specific-methods) for details.
</Tip>

### Invalid outputs

While structured outputs guarantee schema compliance in most cases, there are scenarios where the output may not match your schema:

**Refusals** (`stop_reason: "refusal"`)

Claude maintains its safety and helpfulness properties even when using structured outputs. If Claude refuses a request for safety reasons:

- The response will have `stop_reason: "refusal"`
- You'll receive a 200 status code
- You'll be billed for the tokens generated
- The output may not match your schema because the refusal message takes precedence over schema constraints

**Token limit reached** (`stop_reason: "max_tokens"`)

If the response is cut off due to reaching the `max_tokens` limit:

- The response will have `stop_reason: "max_tokens"`
- The output may be incomplete and not match your schema
- Retry with a higher `max_tokens` value to get the complete structured output

### Schema validation errors

If your schema uses unsupported features or is too complex, you'll receive a 400 error:

**"Too many recursive definitions in schema"**
- Cause: Schema has excessive or cyclic recursive definitions
- Solution: Simplify schema structure, reduce nesting depth

**"Schema is too complex"**
- Cause: Schema exceeds complexity limits
- Solution: Break into smaller schemas, simplify structure, or reduce the number of tools marked as `strict: true`

For persistent issues with valid schemas, [contact support](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support) with your schema definition.

## Feature compatibility

**Works with:**
- **[Batch processing](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing)**: Process structured outputs at scale with 50% discount
- **[Token counting](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting)**: Count tokens without compilation
- **[Streaming](/docs/en/build-with-claude/streaming)**: Stream structured outputs like normal responses
- **Combined usage**: Use JSON outputs (`output_config.format`) and strict tool use (`strict: true`) together in the same request

**Incompatible with:**
- **[Citations](/docs/en/build-with-claude/citations)**: Citations require interleaving citation blocks with text, which conflicts with strict JSON schema constraints. Returns 400 error if citations enabled with `output_config.format`.
- **[Message Prefilling](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prefill-claudes-response)**: Incompatible with JSON outputs

<Tip>
**Grammar scope**: Grammars apply only to Claude's direct output, not to tool use calls, tool results, or thinking tags (when using [Extended Thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)). Grammar state resets between sections, allowing Claude to think freely while still producing structured output in the final response.
